Written as an exercise to learn Emacs Lisp (including the 'cl package) as a
real PL, rather than a series of incantations in a configuration file.

Also desired: a basic grasp of Common Lisp. This was motivated primarily by
a desire to acquire historical knowledge (as opposed to a PL for practical use,
as I treat Emacs Lisp and Haskell, among other less-than-popular choices.)

I was to learn all this, as well as perspective on different Lisps and styles
of programming (FP, OOP, imperative, etc.), by reading Barski's "Land of Lisp".

Throughout the code, I comment and explain departures from Barski's Common Lisp.

I deliberately chose NOT to attempt to rewrite the games in a functional style.

An important part of this learning exercise, besides writing the code visible
in this repository, was testing the examples Barski provided in the book, which
demonstrated Common Lisp's behavior in the REPL.

It was necessary to test all of those examples in order to determine where the
behavior of Emacs Lisp differed from that of Common Lisp.
