The/AT door/NN was/BEDZ answered/VBN by/IN a/AT slender/JJ man/NN in/IN his/PP$ sixties/NNS --/-- straight-backed/JJ ,/, somewhat/QL clerical/JJ in/IN manner/NN ,/, wearing/VBG rimless/JJ glasses/NNS ./.

When/WRB Joe/NP identified/VBD himself/PPL ,/, he/PPS nodded/VBD ,/, unsmiling/JJ ,/, and/CC ushered/VBD him/PPO into/IN a/AT sedate/JJ living/VBG room/NN ./.

Mrs./NP Kahler/NP joined/VBD them/PPO ./.

She/PPS had/HVD a/AT dried-out/JJ quality/NN --/-- a/AT gray/JJ ,/, lean/JJ woman/NN ,/, not/* unattractive/JJ ./.

Both/ABX were/BED dressed/VBN rather/QL formally/RB ./.

The/AT man/NN wore/VBD a/AT vest/NN and/CC a/AT tie/NN ,/, the/AT woman/NN had/HVD on/RP a/AT dark/JJ green/JJ dress/NN and/CC three/CD strands/NNS of/IN pearls/NNS ./.

``/`` Funny/JJ thing/NN ''/'' ,/, Mr./NP Kahler/NP said/VBD ,/, when/WRB they/PPSS were/BED seated/VBN ,/, ``/`` when/WRB I/PPSS heard/VBD you/PPO ringing/VBG ,/, I/PPSS figured/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ that/DT guy/NN down/IN the/AT block/NN ,/, Hausman/NP ''/'' ./.

McFeeley/NP looked/VBD puzzled/VBN ./.

Kahler/NP continued/VBD :/: ``/`` I/PPSS fixed/VBD his/PP$ dog/NN the/AT other/AP day/NN and/CC I/PPSS guess/VB he's/PPS+BEZ sore/JJ ,/, so/CS I/PPSS expected/VBD him/PPO to/TO come/VB barging/VBG in/RP ''/'' ./.

Mr./NP Kahler/NP went/VBD on/RP to/TO explain/VB how/WRB Hausman's/NP$ fox/NN terrier/NN had/HVD been/BEN ``/`` making/VBG ''/'' in/IN his/PP$ flower/NN beds/NNS ./.

The/AT dog/NN refused/VBD to/TO be/BE scared/VBN off/RP ,/, so/RB Kahler/NP had/HVD purchased/VBN some/DTI small/JJ firecrackers/NNS ./.

He/PPS would/MD lay/VB in/IN wait/NN in/IN the/AT garage/NN ,/, and/CC when/WRB the/AT terrier/NN came/VBD scratching/VBG around/RB ,/, he'd/PPS+MD let/VB fly/VB with/IN a/AT cherry/JJ bomb/NN ./.

``/`` Scared/VBD the/AT hell/NN out/IN of/IN him/PPO ''/'' ,/, Kahler/NP grinned/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PPSS hit/VB him/PPO in/IN the/AT ass/NN once/RB ''/'' ./.

``/`` Finally/RB ,/, all/ABN I/PPSS needed/VBD was/BEDZ to/TO throw/VB a/AT little/AP piece/NN of/IN red/JJ wood/NN that/WPS looked/VBD like/CS a/AT firecracker/NN and/CC that/QL dumb/JJ dog/NN would/MD run/VB ki-yi-ing/VBG for/IN his/PP$ life/NN ''/'' ./.

In/IN the/AT dim/JJ underwater/JJ light/NN they/PPSS dressed/VBD and/CC straightened/VBD up/RP the/AT room/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB they/PPSS went/VBD across/IN the/AT hall/NN to/IN the/AT kitchen/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ intimidated/VBN by/IN the/AT stove/NN ./.

He/PPS found/VBD the/AT pilot/NN light/NN and/CC turned/VBD on/IN one/CD of/IN the/AT burners/NNS for/IN her/PPO ./.

The/AT gas/NN flamed/VBD up/RP two/CD inches/NNS high/JJ ./.

They/PPSS found/VBD the/AT teakettle/NN ./.

And/CC put/VBD water/NN on/RP to/TO boil/VB and/CC then/RB searched/VBD through/IN the/AT icebox/NN ./.

Several/AP sections/NNS of/IN a/AT loaf/NN of/IN dark/JJ bread/NN ;/. ;/.

In/IN their/PP$ search/NN for/IN what/WDT turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/BE the/AT right/JJ breakfast/NN china/NN but/CC the/AT wrong/JJ table/NN silver/NN ,/, they/PPSS opened/VBD every/AT cupboard/NN door/NN in/IN the/AT kitchen/NN and/CC pantry/NN ./.

``/`` Do/DO you/PPSS want/VB to/TO call/VB Eugene/NP ''/'' ?/. ?/.

He/PPS didn't/DOD* ,/, but/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ not/* really/RB a/AT question/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB he/PPS left/VBD the/AT room/NN ,/, walked/VBD down/IN the/AT hall/NN to/IN the/AT front/NN of/IN the/AT apartment/NN ,/, hesitated/VBD ,/, and/CC then/RB knocked/VBD lightly/RB on/IN the/AT closed/VBN door/NN of/IN the/AT study/NN ./.

A/AT sleepy/JJ voice/NN answered/VBD ./.

``/`` Le/AT petit/JJ dejeuner/NN ''/'' ,/, Harold/NP said/VBD ,/, in/IN an/AT accent/NN that/WPS did/DOD credit/NN to/IN Miss/NP Sloan/NP ,/, his/PP$ high-school/NN French/NP teacher/NN ./.

They/PPSS assured/VBD him/PPO that/CS they/PPSS did/DOD not/* expect/VB or/CC need/VB to/TO be/BE entertained/VBN ./.

Harold/NP put/VBD a/AT teaspoonful/NN of/IN powdered/VBN coffee/NN in/IN his/PP$ cup/NN and/CC filled/VBD it/PPO with/IN hot/JJ water/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, stirring/VBG ,/, he/PPS sat/VBD back/RB in/IN his/PP$ chair/NN ./.

The/AT chair/NN creaked/VBD ./.

Every/AT time/NN he/PPS moved/VBD or/CC said/VBD something/PN ,/, the/AT chair/NN creaked/VBD again/RB ./.

Eugene/NP was/BEDZ not/* entirely/RB silent/JJ ,/, or/CC openly/RB rude/JJ --/-- unless/CS asking/VBG Harold/NP to/TO move/VB to/IN another/DT chair/NN and/CC placing/VBG himself/PPL in/IN the/AT fauteuil/NN that/WPS creaked/VBD so/QL alarmingly/RB was/BEDZ an/AT act/NN of/IN rudeness/NN ./.

Through/IN the/AT open/JJ window/NN they/PPSS heard/VBD sounds/NNS below/RB in/IN the/AT street/NN :/: cartwheels/NNS ,/, a/AT tired/JJ horse's/NN$ plodding/VBG step/NN ,/, voices/NNS ./.

Harold/NP indicated/VBD the/AT photograph/NN on/IN the/AT wall/NN and/CC asked/VBD what/WDT church/NN the/AT stone/NN sculpture/NN was/BEDZ in/IN ./.

Eugene/NP told/VBD him/PPO and/CC he/PPS promptly/RB forgot/VBD ./.

They/PPSS passed/VBD the/AT marmalade/NN ,/, the/AT bread/NN ,/, the/AT black-market/NN butter/NN ,/, back/RB and/CC forth/RB ./.

Nothing/PN was/BEDZ said/VBN about/IN hotels/NNS or/CC train/NN journeys/NNS ./.

They/PPSS all/ABN three/CD had/HVD another/DT cup/NN of/IN coffee/NN ./.

Eugene/NP was/BEDZ in/IN his/PP$ pajamas/NNS and/CC dressing/VBG gown/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN his/PP$ large/JJ feet/NNS he/PPS wore/VBD yellow/JJ Turkish/JJ slippers/NNS that/WPS turned/VBD up/RP at/IN the/AT toes/NNS ./.

``/`` Excuse/VB me/PPO ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD in/IN Berlitz/NP English/NP ,/, and/CC got/VBD up/RP and/CC left/VBD them/PPO ,/, to/TO bathe/VB and/CC dress/VB ./.

The/AT first/OD shrill/JJ ring/NN of/IN the/AT telephone/NN brought/VBD Harold/NP out/RP into/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

He/PPS realized/VBD that/CS he/PPS had/HVD no/AT idea/NN where/WRB the/AT telephone/NN was/BEDZ ./.

At/IN that/DT moment/NN the/AT bathroom/NN door/NN flew/VBD open/JJ and/CC Eugene/NP came/VBD out/RP ,/, with/IN his/PP$ face/NN lathered/VBN for/IN shaving/VBG ,/, and/CC strode/VBD down/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, tying/VBG the/AT sash/NN of/IN his/PP$ dressing/VBG gown/NN as/CS he/PPS went/VBD ./.

The/AT telephone/NN was/BEDZ in/IN the/AT study/NN but/CC the/AT ringing/NN came/VBD from/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

Between/IN the/AT telephone/NN and/CC the/AT wall/NN plug/NN there/EX was/BEDZ sixty/CD feet/NNS of/IN cord/NN ,/, and/CC when/WRB the/AT conversation/NN came/VBD to/IN an/AT end/NN ,/, Eugene/NP carried/VBD the/AT instrument/NN with/IN him/PPO the/AT whole/JJ length/NN of/IN the/AT apartment/NN ,/, to/IN his/PP$ bathroom/NN ,/, where/WRB it/PPS rang/VBD three/CD more/AP times/NNS while/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ shaving/VBG and/CC in/IN the/AT tub/NN ./.

Before/CS he/PPS left/VBD the/AT apartment/NN he/PPS knocked/VBD on/IN their/PP$ door/NN and/CC asked/VBD if/CS there/EX was/BEDZ anything/PN he/PPS could/MD do/DO for/IN them/PPO ./.

Harold/NP shook/VBD his/PP$ head/NN ./.

``/`` Sabine/NP called/VBD a/AT few/AP minutes/NNS ago/RB ''/'' ,/, Eugene/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` She/PPS wants/VBZ you/PPO and/CC Barbara/NP to/TO have/HV dinner/NN with/IN her/PPO tomorrow/NR night/NN ''/'' ./.

He/PPS handed/VBD Harold/NP a/AT key/NN to/IN the/AT front/JJ door/NN ,/, and/CC cautioned/VBD him/PPO against/IN leaving/VBG it/PPO unlocked/VBN while/CS they/PPSS were/BED out/RP of/IN the/AT apartment/NN ./.

When/WRB enough/AP time/NN had/HVD elapsed/VBN so/CS that/CS there/EX was/BEDZ little/AP likelihood/NN of/IN his/PP$ returning/VBG for/IN something/PN he/PPS had/HVD forgotten/VBN ,/, Harold/NP went/VBD out/RP into/IN the/AT hall/NN and/CC stood/VBD looking/VBG into/IN one/CD room/NN after/IN another/DT ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT most/QL important-looking/JJ cradle/NN he/PPS had/HVD ever/RB seen/VBN ./.

A/AT young/JJ woman/NN who/WPS looked/VBD like/CS Alix/NP ,/, with/IN her/PP$ two/CD children/NNS ./.

Professor/NN Cestre/NP ,/, could/MD it/PPO be/BE ?/. ?/.

With/IN the/AT metal/NN shutters/NNS closed/VBN ,/, the/AT dining/VBG room/NN was/BEDZ so/QL dark/JJ that/CS it/PPS seemed/VBD still/RB night/NN in/IN there/RB ./.

One/CD of/IN the/AT drawing-room/NN shutters/NNS was/BEDZ partly/QL open/JJ and/CC he/PPS made/VBD out/RP the/AT shapes/NNS of/IN chairs/NNS and/CC sofas/NNS ,/, which/WDT seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE upholstered/VBN in/IN brown/JJ or/CC russet/JJ velvet/NN ./.

The/AT curtains/NNS were/BED of/IN the/AT same/AP material/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX were/BED some/DTI big/JJ oil/NN paintings/NNS --/-- portraits/NNS in/IN the/AT style/NN of/IN Lancret/NP and/CC Boucher/NP ./.

Though/CS ,/, taken/VBN individually/RB ,/, the/AT big/JJ rooms/NNS were/BED ,/, or/CC seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE ,/, square/JJ ,/, the/AT apartment/NN as/CS a/AT whole/NN formed/VBD a/AT triangle/NN ./.

The/AT apex/NN ,/, the/AT study/NN where/WRB Eugene/NP slept/VBD ,/, was/BEDZ light/JJ and/CC bright/JJ and/CC airy/JJ and/CC cheerful/JJ ./.

The/AT window/NN looked/VBD out/RP on/IN the/AT Place/NN Redoute/NN --/-- it/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT only/AP window/NN of/IN the/AT apartment/NN that/WPS did/DOD ./.

Looking/VBG around/RB slowly/RB ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD a/AT marble/NN fireplace/NN ,/, a/AT desk/NN ,/, a/AT low/JJ bookcase/NN of/IN mahogany/NN with/IN criss-crossed/JJ brass/NN wire/NN instead/RB of/IN glass/NN panes/NNS in/IN the/AT doors/NNS ./.

The/AT daybed/NN Eugene/NP had/HVD slept/VBN in/IN ,/, made/VBN up/RP now/RB with/IN its/PP$ dark-brown/JJ velours/NN cover/NN and/CC pillows/NNS ./.

The/AT portable/JJ record/NN player/NN with/IN a/AT pile/NN of/IN classical/JJ records/NNS beside/IN it/PPO ./.

The/AT titles/NNS he/PPS could/MD read/VB easily/RB through/IN the/AT criss-crossed/JJ wires/NNS :/: works/NNS on/IN theology/NN ,/, astral/JJ physics/NN ,/, history/NN ,/, biology/NN ,/, political/JJ science/NN ./.

No/AT poetry/NN ./.

He/PPS moved/VBD over/RP to/IN the/AT desk/NN and/CC stood/VBD looking/VBG at/IN the/AT papers/NNS on/IN it/PPO but/CC not/* touching/VBG anything/PN ./.

The/AT clock/NN on/IN the/AT mantel/NN piece/NN was/BEDZ scandalized/VBN and/CC ticked/VBD so/QL loudly/RB that/CS he/PPS glanced/VBD at/IN it/PPO over/IN his/PP$ shoulder/NN and/CC then/RB quickly/RB left/VBD the/AT room/NN ./.

The/AT concierge/NN called/VBD out/RP to/IN them/PPO as/CS they/PPSS were/BED passing/VBG through/IN the/AT foyer/NN ./.

Rather/RB than/CS sit/VB around/RB waiting/VBG for/CS the/AT suitcases/NNS to/TO be/BE delivered/VBN ,/, they/PPSS had/HVD gone/VBN sight-seeing/VBG ./.

They/PPSS went/VBD to/IN the/AT Flea/NN Market/NN ,/, expecting/VBG to/TO find/VB the/AT treasures/NNS of/IN Europe/NP ,/, and/CC found/VBD instead/RB a/AT duplication/NN of/IN that/DT long/JJ double/JJ row/NN of/IN booths/NNS in/IN Tours/NP ./.

In/IN his/PP$ concept/NN there/EX could/MD be/BE no/AT one/PN else/RB present/RB ./.

His/PP$ first/OD desire/NN was/BEDZ to/TO create/VB a/AT mother/NN and/CC son/NN alone/RB in/IN the/AT universe/NN ./.

When/WRB might/MD Mary/NP have/HV had/HVN that/DT moment/NN to/TO hold/VB her/PP$ child/NN on/IN her/PP$ lap/NN ?/. ?/.

Those/DTS who/WPS saw/VBD his/PP$ finished/VBN Pieta/NP would/MD take/VB the/AT place/NN of/IN the/AT biblical/JJ witnesses/NNS ./.

These/DTS would/MD be/BE two/CD human/NN beings/NNS ,/, whom/WPO God/NP had/HVD chosen/VBN ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD close/RB to/IN Mary/NP ,/, having/HVG spent/VBN so/QL long/JJ concentrating/VBG on/IN the/AT beginning/NN of/IN her/PP$ journey/NN ./.

Now/RB she/PPS was/BEDZ intensely/QL alive/JJ ,/, anguished/VBN ;/. ;/.

Even/RB though/CS he/PPS would/MD later/RBR be/BE resurrected/VBN ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ at/IN this/DT moment/NN dead/JJ indeed/RB ,/, the/AT expression/NN on/IN his/PP$ face/NN reflecting/VBG what/WDT he/PPS had/HVD gone/VBN through/RP on/IN the/AT cross/NN ./.

Jesus'/NP$ inert/JJ body/NN would/MD be/BE passive/JJ ,/, his/PP$ eyes/NNS closed/VBN ./.

Mary/NP would/MD have/HV to/TO carry/VB the/AT human/NN communication/NN ./.

This/DT seemed/VBD right/JJ to/IN him/PPO ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT relief/NN to/TO shift/VB in/IN his/PP$ mind/NN to/IN technical/JJ problems/NNS ./.

Since/CS his/PP$ Christ/NP was/BEDZ to/TO be/BE life/NN size/NN ,/, how/WRB was/BEDZ Mary/NP to/TO hold/VB him/PPO on/IN her/PP$ lap/NN without/IN the/AT relationship/NN seeming/VBG ungainly/JJ ?/. ?/.

His/PP$ Mary/NP would/MD be/BE slender/JJ of/IN limb/NN and/CC delicate/JJ of/IN proportion/NN ,/, yet/RB she/PPS must/MD hold/VB this/DT full-grown/JJ man/NN as/QL securely/RB and/CC convincingly/RB as/CS she/PPS would/MD a/AT child/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ only/RB one/CD way/NN to/TO accomplish/VB this/DT :/: by/IN design/NN ,/, by/IN drawing/VBG diagrams/NNS and/CC sketches/NNS in/IN which/WDT he/PPS probed/VBD the/AT remotest/JJT corner/NN of/IN his/PP$ mind/NN for/IN creative/JJ ideas/NNS to/TO carry/VB his/PP$ concept/NN ./.

He/PPS started/VBD by/IN making/VBG free/JJ sketches/NNS to/TO loosen/VB up/RP his/PP$ thinking/NN so/CS that/CS images/NNS would/MD appear/VB on/IN paper/NN ./.

Visually/RB ,/, these/DTS approximated/VBD what/WDT he/PPS was/BEDZ feeling/VBG within/IN himself/PPL ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN he/PPS started/VBD walking/VBG the/AT streets/NNS ,/, peering/VBG at/IN the/AT people/NNS passing/VBG or/CC shopping/VBG at/IN the/AT stalls/NNS ,/, storing/VBG up/RP fresh/JJ impressions/NNS of/IN what/WDT they/PPSS looked/VBD like/JJ ,/, how/WRB they/PPSS moved/VBD ./.

In/IN particular/JJ he/PPS sought/VBD the/AT gentle/JJ ,/, sweet-faced/JJ nuns/NNS ,/, with/IN head/NN coverings/NNS and/CC veils/NNS coming/VBG to/IN the/AT middle/NN of/IN their/PP$ foreheads/NNS ,/, remembering/VBG their/PP$ expressions/NNS until/CS he/PPS reached/VBD home/NR and/CC set/VBD them/PPO down/RP on/IN paper/NN ./.

Discovering/VBG that/CS draperies/NNS could/MD be/BE designed/VBN to/TO serve/VB structural/JJ purposes/NNS ,/, he/PPS began/VBD a/AT study/NN of/IN the/AT anatomy/NN of/IN folds/NNS ./.

He/PPS improvised/VBD as/CS he/PPS went/VBD along/RB ,/, completing/VBG a/AT life-size/NN clay/NN figure/NN ,/, then/RB bought/VBD yards/NNS of/IN an/AT inexpensive/JJ material/NN from/IN a/AT draper/NN ,/, wet/VBD the/AT lightweight/JJ cloth/NN in/IN a/AT basin/NN and/CC covered/VBD it/PPO over/RP with/IN clay/NN that/WPS Argiento/NP brought/VBD from/IN the/AT bank/NN of/IN the/AT Tiber/NP ,/, to/IN the/AT consistency/NN of/IN thick/JJ mud/NN ./.

No/AT fold/NN could/MD be/BE accidental/JJ ,/, each/DT turn/NN of/IN the/AT drapery/NN had/HVD to/TO serve/VB organically/RB ,/, to/TO cover/VB the/AT Madonna's/NP$ slender/JJ legs/NNS and/CC feet/NNS so/CS that/CS they/PPSS would/MD give/VB substantive/JJ support/NN to/IN Christ's/NP$ body/NN ,/, to/TO intensify/VB her/PPO inner/JJ turmoil/NN ./.

When/WRB the/AT cloth/NN dried/VBD and/CC stiffened/VBD ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD what/WDT adjustments/NNS had/HVD to/TO be/BE made/VBN ./.

``/`` So/RB that's/DT+BEZ sculpture/NN ''/'' ,/, commented/VBD Argiento/NP wryly/RB ,/, when/WRB he/PPS had/HVD sluiced/VBN down/IN the/AT floor/NN for/IN a/AT week/NN ,/, ``/`` making/VBG mud/NN pies/NNS ''/'' ./.

They/PPSS can/MD have/HV as/QL much/AP tactile/JJ appeal/NN as/CS flesh/NN and/CC bone/NN ''/'' ./.

He/PPS went/VBD into/IN the/AT Jewish/JJ quarter/NN ,/, wanting/VBG to/TO draw/VB Hebraic/JJ faces/NNS so/CS that/CS he/PPS could/MD reach/VB a/AT visual/JJ understanding/NN of/IN how/WRB Christ/NP might/MD have/HV looked/VBN ./.

The/AT Jewish/JJ section/NN was/BEDZ in/IN Trastevere/NP ,/, near/IN the/AT Tiber/NP at/IN the/AT church/NN of/IN San/NP Francesco/NP a/IN Ripa/NN ./.

The/AT colony/NN had/HVD been/BEN small/JJ until/CS the/AT Spanish/JJ Inquisition/NN of/IN 1492/CD drove/VBD many/AP Jews/NPS into/IN Rome/NP ./.

many/AP of/IN their/PP$ gifted/JJ members/NNS were/BED prominent/JJ in/IN the/AT Vatican/NP as/CS physicians/NNS ,/, musicians/NNS ,/, bankers/NNS ./.

The/AT men/NNS did/DOD not/* object/VB to/IN his/PP$ sketching/VBG them/PPO while/CS they/PPSS went/VBD about/RB their/PP$ work/NN ,/, but/CC no/AT one/PN could/MD be/BE persuaded/VBN to/TO come/VB to/IN his/PP$ studio/NN to/TO pose/VB ./.

One/CD reason/NN the/AT portwatchers/NNS let/VB Sposato/NP take/VB them/PPO over/RP was/BEDZ to/TO get/VB the/AT protection/NN of/IN his/PP$ musclemen/NNS ./.

He/PPS wanted/VBD desperately/RB to/TO see/VB Kayabashi/NP defeated/VBD ,/, the/AT Communists/NNS in/IN the/AT village/NN rooted/VBD out/RP ,/, the/AT mission/NN standing/VBG triumphant/JJ ,/, for/CS in/IN the/AT triumph/NN of/IN the/AT Lord/NN he/PPS himself/PPL would/MD be/BE triumphant/JJ ,/, too/RB ./.

But/CC perhaps/RB this/DT was/BEDZ a/AT part/NN of/IN the/AT eternal/JJ plan/NN ,/, that/DT man's/NN$ ambition/NN when/WRB linked/VBN with/IN God/NP would/MD be/BE a/AT driving/VBG ,/, indefatigable/JJ force/NN for/IN good/NN in/IN the/AT world/NN ./.

How/WRB foolish/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ to/TO try/VB to/TO fathom/VB the/AT truth/NN in/IN an/AT area/NN where/WRB only/RB faith/NN would/MD suffice/VB ./.

He/PPS would/MD have/HV to/TO work/VB without/IN questioning/VBG the/AT motives/NNS which/WDT made/VBD him/PPO work/VB and/CC content/VB himself/PPL with/IN the/AT thought/NN that/CS the/AT eventual/JJ victory/NN ,/, however/WRB it/PPS was/BEDZ brought/VBN about/RB ,/, would/MD be/BE sweet/JJ indeed/QLP ./.

His/PP$ first/OD move/NN was/BEDZ to/TO send/VB Hino/NP to/IN the/AT village/NN to/TO spend/VB a/AT few/AP days/NNS ./.

His/PP$ arm/NN had/HVD been/BEN giving/VBG him/PPO some/DTI trouble/NN and/CC Rector/NP was/BEDZ not/* enough/AP of/IN a/AT medical/JJ expert/NN to/TO determine/VB whether/CS it/PPS had/HVD healed/VBN improperly/RB or/CC whether/CS Hino/NP was/BEDZ simply/RB rebelling/VBG against/IN the/AT tedious/JJ work/NN in/IN the/AT print/NN shop/NN ,/, using/VBG the/AT stiffness/NN in/IN his/PP$ arm/NN as/CS an/AT excuse/NN ./.

In/IN any/DTI event/NN Rector/NP sent/VBD him/PPO to/IN the/AT local/JJ hospital/NN to/TO have/HV it/PPO checked/VBD ,/, telling/VBG him/PPO to/TO keep/VB his/PP$ ears/NNS open/JJ while/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN the/AT village/NN to/TO see/VB if/CS he/PPS could/MD find/VB out/RP what/WDT Kayabashi/NP was/BEDZ planning/VBG ./.

Hino/NP was/BEDZ elated/VBN at/IN the/AT prospect/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ allowed/VBN to/TO spend/VB his/PP$ nights/NNS at/IN an/AT inn/NN near/IN the/AT hospital/NN and/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ given/VBN some/DTI extra/JJ money/NN to/TO go/VB to/IN the/AT pachinko/NN parlor/NN --/-- an/AT excellent/JJ place/NN to/TO make/VB contact/NN with/IN the/AT enemy/NN ./.

He/PPS left/VBD with/IN all/ABN the/AT joyous/JJ spirit/NN of/IN a/AT child/NN going/VBG on/IN a/AT holiday/NN ,/, nodding/VBG attentively/RB as/CS Rector/NP gave/VBD him/PPO his/PP$ final/JJ instructions/NNS ./.

he/PPS was/BEDZ simply/RB to/TO listen/VB and/CC report/VB back/RB what/WDT he/PPS heard/VBD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT ridiculous/JJ situation/NN and/CC Rector/NP knew/VBD it/PPO ,/, for/CS Hino/NP ,/, frankly/RB partisan/JJ ,/, openly/RB gregarious/JJ ,/, would/MD make/VB a/AT poor/JJ espionage/NN agent/NN ./.

If/CS he/PPS wanted/VBD to/TO know/VB anything/PN ,/, he/PPS would/MD end/VB up/RP asking/VBG about/IN it/PPO point-blank/RB ,/, but/CC in/IN this/DT guileless/JJ manner/NN he/PPS would/MD probably/RB receive/VB more/QL truthful/JJ answers/NNS than/CS if/CS he/PPS tried/VBD to/TO get/VB them/PPO by/IN indirection/NN ./.

In/IN all/ABN of/IN his/PP$ experience/NN in/IN the/AT mission/NN field/NN Rector/NP had/HVD never/RB seen/VBN a/AT convert/NN quite/QL like/CS Hino/NP ./.

From/IN the/AT moment/NN that/CS Hino/NP had/HVD first/RB walked/VBN into/IN the/AT mission/NN to/TO ask/VB for/IN a/AT job/NN ,/, any/DTI job/NN --/-- his/PP$ qualifications/NNS neatly/RB written/VBN on/IN a/AT piece/NN of/IN paper/NN in/IN a/AT precise/JJ hand/NN --/-- he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN ready/JJ to/TO become/VB a/AT Christian/JJ ./.

He/PPS had/HVD already/RB been/BEN studying/VBG the/AT Bible/NP ;/. ;/.

he/PPS knew/VBD the/AT fundamentals/NNS ,/, and/CC after/CS studying/VBG with/IN Fletcher/NP for/IN a/AT time/NN he/PPS approached/VBD Rector/NP ,/, announced/VBD that/CS he/PPS wanted/VBD to/TO be/BE baptized/VBN and/CC that/DT was/BEDZ that/DT ./.

Rector/NN had/HVD never/RB been/BEN able/JJ to/TO find/VB out/RP much/AP about/IN Hino's/NP$ past/NN ./.

Hino/NP talked/VBD very/QL little/JJ about/IN himself/PPL except/IN for/IN the/AT infrequent/JJ times/NNS when/WRB he/PPS used/VBD a/AT personal/JJ illustration/NN in/IN connection/NN with/IN another/DT subject/NN ./.

Putting/VBG the/AT pieces/NNS of/IN this/DT mosaic/NN together/RB ,/, Rector/NP had/HVD the/AT vague/JJ outlines/NNS of/IN a/AT biography/NN ./.

Hino/NP was/BEDZ the/AT fourth/OD son/NN of/IN an/AT elderly/JJ farmer/NN who/WPS lived/VBD on/IN the/AT coast/NN ,/, in/IN Chiba/NP ,/, and/CC divided/VBD his/PP$ life/NN between/IN the/AT land/NN and/CC the/AT sea/NN ,/, supplementing/VBG the/AT marginal/JJ livelihood/NN on/IN his/PP$ small/JJ rented/VBN farm/NN with/IN seasonal/JJ employment/NN on/IN a/AT fishing/VBG boat/NN ./.

Without/IN exception/NN Hino's/NP$ brothers/NNS turned/VBD to/IN either/CC one/PN or/CC both/ABX of/IN their/PP$ father's/NN$ occupations/NNS ,/, but/CC Hino/NP showed/VBD a/AT talent/NN for/IN neither/DTX and/CC instead/RB spent/VBD most/AP of/IN his/PP$ time/NN on/IN the/AT beach/NN where/WRB he/PPS repaired/VBD nets/NNS and/CC proved/VBD immensely/RB popular/JJ as/CS a/AT storyteller/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD gone/VBN into/IN the/AT Japanese/JJ navy/NN ,/, had/HVD been/BEN trained/VBN as/CS an/AT officer/NN ,/, had/HVD participated/VBN in/IN one/CD or/CC two/CD battles/NNS --/-- he/PPS never/RB went/VBD into/IN detail/NN regarding/IN his/PP$ military/NN experience/NN --/-- and/CC at/IN the/AT age/NN of/IN twenty-five/CD ,/, quite/QL as/CS a/AT bolt/NN out/IN of/IN the/AT blue/JJ ,/, he/PPS had/HVD walked/VBN into/IN the/AT mission/NN as/CS if/CS he/PPS belonged/VBD here/RB and/CC had/HVD become/VBN a/AT Christian/JJ ./.

Rector/NN was/BEDZ often/RB curious/JJ ;/. ;/.

often/RB tempted/VBN to/TO ask/VB questions/NNS but/CC he/PPS never/RB did/DOD ./.

If/CS and/CC when/WRB Hino/NP decided/VBD to/TO tell/VB him/PPO about/IN his/PP$ experiences/NNS ,/, he/PPS would/MD do/DO so/CS unasked/JJ ./.

Rector/NN had/HVD no/AT doubt/NN that/WPS Hino/NP would/MD come/VB back/RB from/IN the/AT village/NN bursting/VBG with/IN information/NN ,/, ready/JJ to/TO impart/VB it/PPO with/IN his/PP$ customary/JJ gusto/NN ,/, liberally/RB embellished/VBN with/IN his/PP$ active/JJ imagnation/NN ./.

When/WRB the/AT telephone/NN rang/VBD on/IN the/AT day/NN after/CS Hino/NP went/VBD down/RP to/IN the/AT village/NN ,/, Rector/NP had/HVD a/AT hunch/NN it/PPS would/MD be/BE Hino/NP with/IN some/DTI morsel/NN of/IN information/NN too/QL important/JJ to/TO wait/VB until/IN his/PP$ return/NN ,/, for/CS there/EX were/BED few/AP telephones/NNS in/IN the/AT village/NN and/CC the/AT phone/NN in/IN Rector's/NP$ office/NN rarely/RB rang/VBD unless/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ important/JJ ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ surprised/VBN to/TO find/VB Kayabashi's/NP$ secretary/NN on/IN the/AT other/AP end/NN of/IN the/AT line/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ even/QL more/QL startled/VBN when/WRB he/PPS heard/VBD what/WDT Kayabashi/NP wanted/VBD ./.

The/AT oyabun/NN was/BEDZ entertaining/VBG a/AT group/NN of/IN dignitaries/NNS ,/, the/AT secretary/NN said/VBD ,/, businessmen/NNS from/IN Tokyo/NP for/IN the/AT most/AP part/NN ,/, and/CC Kayabashi/NP wished/VBD to/TO show/VB them/PPO the/AT mission/NN ./.

They/PPSS had/HVD never/RB seen/VBN one/CD before/RB and/CC had/HVD expressed/VBN a/AT curiosity/NN about/IN it/PPO ./.

``/`` Oh/UH ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Rector/NN said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PPSS guess/VB it/PPO will/MD be/BE all/QL right/RB ./.

When/WRB would/MD the/AT oyabun/NN like/VB to/TO bring/VB his/PP$ guests/NNS up/IN here/RB ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` This/DT afternoon/NN ''/'' ,/, the/AT secretary/NN said/VBD ./.

``/`` All/QL right/JJ ''/'' ,/, Rector/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PPSS will/MD be/BE expecting/VBG them/PPO ''/'' ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ about/RB to/TO hang/VB up/IN the/AT phone/NN ,/, but/CC a/AT note/NN of/IN hesitancy/NN in/IN the/AT secretary's/NN$ voice/NN left/VBD the/AT conversation/NN open/JJ ./.

He/PPS had/HVD something/PN more/AP to/TO say/VB ./.

``/`` I/PPSS beg/VB to/TO inquire/VB if/CS the/AT back/NN is/BEZ now/RB safe/JJ for/IN travelers/NNS ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ./.

Rector/NP laughed/VBD despite/IN himself/PPL ./.

``/`` Unless/CS the/AT oyabun/NN has/HVZ been/BEN working/VBG on/IN it/PPO ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ,/, then/RB checked/VBD himself/PPL and/CC added/VBD :/: ``/`` You/PPSS can/MD tell/VB Kayabashi-san/NP that/CS the/AT back/NN road/NN is/BEZ in/IN very/QL good/JJ condition/NN and/CC will/MD be/BE quite/QL safe/JJ for/IN his/PP$ party/NN to/TO use/VB ''/'' ./.

``/`` Arigato/UH gosaimasu/VB ''/'' ./.

The/AT secretary/NN sighed/VBD with/IN relief/NN and/CC then/RB the/AT telephone/NN clicked/VBD in/IN Rector's/NP$ hand/NN ./.

Rector/NP had/HVD no/AT idea/NN why/WRB Kayabashi/NP wanted/VBD to/TO visit/VB the/AT mission/NN ./.

For/IN the/AT oyabun/NN to/TO make/VB such/ABL a/AT trip/NN was/BEDZ either/CC a/AT sign/NN of/IN great/JJ weakness/NN or/CC an/AT indication/NN of/IN equally/QL great/JJ confidence/NN ,/, and/CC from/IN all/ABN the/AT available/JJ information/NN it/PPS was/BEDZ probably/RB the/AT latter/AP ./.

Kayabashi/NP must/MD feel/VB fairly/QL certain/JJ of/IN his/PP$ victory/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB a/AT visit/NN like/CS this/DT ,/, a/AT trip/NN which/WDT could/MD be/BE so/QL easily/RB misinterpreted/VBN by/IN the/AT people/NNS in/IN the/AT village/NN ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ unlikely/JJ that/CS any/DTI businessmen/NNS would/MD spend/VB a/AT day/NN in/IN a/AT Christian/JJ mission/NN out/IN of/IN mere/JJ curiosity/NN ./.

No/RB ,/, Kayabashi/NP was/BEDZ bringing/VBG his/PP$ associates/NNS here/RB for/IN a/AT specific/JJ purpose/NN and/CC Rector/NP would/MD not/* be/BE able/JJ to/TO fathom/VB it/PPO until/CS they/PPSS arrived/VBD ./.

When/WRB he/PPS had/HVD given/VBN the/AT call/NN a/AT few/AP moments/NNS thought/NN ,/, he/PPS went/VBD into/IN the/AT kitchen/NN to/TO ask/VB Mrs./NP Yamata/NP to/TO prepare/VB tea/NN and/CC sushi/NN for/IN the/AT visitors/NNS ,/, using/VBG the/AT formal/JJ English/JJ china/NN and/CC the/AT silver/NN tea/NN service/NN which/WDT had/HVD been/BEN donated/VBN to/IN the/AT mission/NN ,/, then/RB he/PPS went/VBD outside/RB to/TO inspect/VB the/AT grounds/NNS ./.

Fujimoto/NP had/HVD a/AT pile/NN of/IN cuttings/NNS near/IN one/CD side/NN of/IN the/AT lawn/NN ./.

Rector/NP asked/VBD him/PPO to/TO move/VB it/PPO for/IN the/AT time/NN being/BEG ;/. ;/.

he/PPS wanted/VBD the/AT mission/NN compound/NN to/TO be/BE effortlessly/RB spotless/JJ ./.

A/AT good/JJ initial/JJ impression/NN would/MD be/BE important/JJ now/RB ./.

He/PPS went/VBD into/IN the/AT print/NN shop/NN ,/, where/WRB Fletcher/NP had/HVD just/RB finished/VBN cleaning/VBG the/AT press/NN ./.

``/`` How/WRB many/AP pamphlets/NNS do/DO we/PPSS have/HV in/IN stock/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Rector/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PPSS should/MD say/VB about/RB a/AT hundred/CD thousand/CD ''/'' ,/, Fletcher/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Why/WRB ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` I/PPSS would/MD like/VB to/TO enact/VB a/AT little/JJ tableau/NN this/DT afternoon/NN ''/'' ,/, Rector/NP said/VBD ,/, He/PPS explained/VBD about/IN the/AT visit/NN and/CC the/AT effect/NN he/PPS wished/VBD to/TO create/VB ,/, the/AT picture/NN of/IN a/AT very/QL busy/JJ mission/NN ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* wish/VB to/TO deceive/VB Kayabashi/NP exactly/RB ,/, just/RB to/TO display/VB the/AT mission/NN activities/NNS in/IN a/AT graphic/JJ and/CC impressive/JJ manner/NN ./.

Fletcher/NP nodded/VBD as/CS he/PPS listened/VBD to/IN the/AT instructions/NNS and/CC said/VBD he/PPS would/MD arrange/VB the/AT things/NNS Rector/NP requested/VBD ./.

Rector's/NP$ next/AP stop/NN was/BEDZ at/IN the/AT schoolroom/NN ,/, where/WRB Mavis/NP was/BEDZ monitoring/VBG a/AT test/NN ./.

He/PPS beckoned/VBD to/IN her/PPO from/IN the/AT door/NN and/CC she/PPS slipped/VBD quietly/RB outside/RB ./.

He/PPS told/VBD her/PPO of/IN the/AT visitors/NNS and/CC then/RB of/IN his/PP$ plans/NNS ./.

``/`` How/WRB many/AP children/NNS do/DO you/PPO have/HV present/RB today/NR ''/'' ?/. ?/.

She/PPS looked/VBD back/RB toward/IN the/AT schoolroom/NN ./.

``/`` Fifteen/CD ''/'' ,/, she/PPS said/VBD ./.

``/`` No/RB ,/, only/RB fourteen/CD ./.

The/AT little/JJ Ito/NP girl/NN had/HVD had/HVN to/TO go/VB home/NR ./.

Mavis/NP smiled/VBD ./.

``/`` I'll/PPSS+MD try/VB ''/'' ./.

As/CS Rector/NP was/BEDZ walking/VBG back/RB toward/IN the/AT residential/JJ hall/NN ,/, Johnson/NP came/VBD out/RP of/IN the/AT basement/NN and/CC bounded/VBD up/RP to/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` You/PPSS are/BER about/RB to/TO become/VB a/AT first-class/NN surveyor/NN ''/'' ,/, Rector/NP said/VBD ./.

At/IN the/AT inn/NN ,/, which/WDT was/BEDZ situated/VBN close/RB to/IN a/AT broad/JJ weir/NN ,/, Byron/NP was/BEDZ greeted/VBN by/IN the/AT landlord/NN with/IN obsequious/JJ deference/NN and/CC addressed/VBN as/CS ``/`` milord/NN ''/'' ./.

Claire/NP felt/VBD suddenly/RB small/JJ and/CC cheap/JJ ,/, heroine/NN of/IN a/AT trivial/JJ episode/NN in/IN the/AT voluminous/JJ history/NN of/IN Don/NP Juan/NP ./.

A/AT cold/JJ supper/NN was/BEDZ ordered/VBN and/CC a/AT bottle/NN of/IN port/NN ./.

In/IN the/AT corner/NN was/BEDZ the/AT soldier/NN with/IN the/AT white/JJ flag/NN ./.

He/PPS stood/VBD stiffly/RB erect/JJ ,/, clutching/VBG the/AT staff/NN ,/, his/PP$ body/NN half/QL hidden/VBN by/IN the/AT limp/JJ cloth/NN ./.

Watson/NP hardly/RB looked/VBD at/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT man/NN had/HVD come/VBN floundering/VBG aboard/RB the/AT flat-bottomed/JJ barge/NN at/IN the/AT last/AP instant/NN ,/, brandishing/VBG the/AT flag/NN of/IN truce/NN ./.

Someone/PN had/HVD hauled/VBN him/PPO over/IN the/AT side/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS had/HVD remained/VBN silent/JJ while/CS they/PPSS crossed/VBD ./.

An/AT officer/NN with/IN a/AT squad/NN of/IN men/NNS had/HVD been/BEN waiting/VBG on/IN the/AT bank/NN ./.

The/AT men/NNS in/IN the/AT boats/NNS had/HVD started/VBN yelling/VBG happily/RB at/IN first/OD sight/NN of/IN the/AT officer/NN ,/, two/CD of/IN them/PPO calling/VBG him/PPO Billy/NP ./.

When/WRB the/AT boat/NN had/HVD touched/VBN ,/, the/AT weaker/JJR ones/NNS and/CC the/AT two/CD wounded/VBN men/NNS had/HVD been/BEN lifted/VBN out/RP and/CC carried/VBN away/RB by/IN the/AT soldiers/NNS ./.

Watson/NP had/HVD presented/VBN his/PP$ pouch/NN and/CC been/BEN led/VBN to/IN the/AT bombproof/JJ ./.

The/AT officer/NN had/HVD told/VBN him/PPO that/CS both/ABX lists/NNS must/MD be/BE checked/VBN ./.

Watson/NP had/HVD given/VBN his/PP$ name/NN and/CC asked/VBN for/IN a/AT safe-conduct/NN pass/NN ./.

The/AT officer/NN ,/, surprised/VBN ,/, said/VBD he/PPS would/MD have/HV to/TO see/VB ./.

Watson/NP had/HVD nodded/VBN absently/RB and/CC muttered/VBD that/CS he/PPS would/MD check/VB the/AT lists/NNS himself/PPL later/RBR ./.

He/PPS had/HVD peered/VBN through/IN the/AT darkness/NN at/IN the/AT rampart/NN ./.

The/AT men/NNS he/PPS would/MD take/VB back/RB across/IN the/AT river/NN stood/VBD there/RB ,/, but/CC he/PPS turned/VBD away/RB from/IN them/PPO ./.

He/PPS wanted/VBD no/AT part/NN of/IN the/AT emotions/NNS of/IN the/AT exchange/NN ,/, no/AT memory/NN of/IN the/AT joy/NN and/CC gratitude/NN that/WPS other/AP men/NNS felt/VBD ./.

He/PPS had/HVD hoped/VBN to/TO be/BE alone/RB in/IN the/AT bombproof/JJ ,/, but/CC the/AT soldier/NN had/HVD followed/VBN him/PPO ./.

Though/CS Watson/NP carefully/RB ignored/VBD the/AT man/NN ,/, he/PPS could/MD not/* deny/VB his/PP$ presence/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB it/PPS would/MD be/BE better/JJR to/TO speak/VB to/IN him/PPO ,/, since/CS silence/NN could/MD not/* exorcise/VB his/PP$ form/NN ./.

Watson/NP glanced/VBD briefly/RB at/IN him/PPO ,/, seeing/VBG only/RB a/AT body/NN rigidly/RB erect/JJ behind/IN the/AT languid/JJ banner/NN ./.

--/-- We/PPSS won't/MD* be/BE too/QL long/JJ ./.

If/CS my/PP$ pass/NN is/BEZ approved/VBN ,/, I/PPSS may/MD be/BE a/AT half/ABN hour/NN ./.

The/AT soldier/NN answered/VBD in/IN a/AT curious/JJ ,/, muffled/VBN voice/NN ,/, his/PP$ lips/NNS barely/RB moving/VBG ./.

Watson/NP turned/VBD away/RB and/CC did/DOD not/* see/VB the/AT man's/NN$ knees/NNS buckle/VB and/CC his/PP$ body/NN sag/VB ./.

--/-- Yes/RB ,/, sir/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD acknowledged/VBN the/AT man/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ easier/JJR to/TO think/VB now/RB ,/, Watson/NP decided/VBD ./.

The/AT stiff/JJ figure/NN in/IN the/AT corner/NN no/AT longer/JJR blocked/VBD his/PP$ thoughts/NNS ./.

He/PPS paced/VBD slowly/RB ,/, stooping/VBG ,/, staring/VBG at/IN the/AT damp/JJ ,/, slippery/JJ floor/NN ./.

He/PPS tried/VBD to/TO order/VB the/AT words/NNS of/IN the/AT three/CD Union/NN officers/NNS ,/, seeking/VBG to/TO create/VB some/DTI coherent/JJ portrait/NN of/IN the/AT dead/JJ boy/NN ./.

But/CC he/PPS groped/VBD blindly/RB ./.

His/PP$ lack/NN of/IN success/NN steadily/RB eroded/VBD his/PP$ interest/NN ./.

He/PPS stopped/VBD pacing/VBG ,/, leaned/VBD against/IN the/AT dank/JJ ,/, timbered/VBN wall/NN and/CC let/VB his/PP$ mind/NN drift/VB ./.

A/AT feeling/NN of/IN futility/NN ,/, an/AT enervation/NN of/IN mind/NN greater/JJR than/CS any/DTI fatigue/NN he/PPS had/HVD ever/RB known/VBN ,/, seeped/VBD through/IN him/PPO ./.

What/WDT in/IN the/AT name/NN of/IN God/NP was/BEDZ he/PPS doing/VBG ,/, crouched/VBN in/IN a/AT timbered/VBN pit/NN on/IN the/AT wrong/JJ bank/NN of/IN the/AT river/NN ?/. ?/.

Why/WRB had/HVD he/PPS crossed/VBD the/AT dark/JJ water/NN ,/, to/TO bring/VB back/RB a/AT group/NN of/IN reclaimed/VBN soldiers/NNS or/CC to/TO skulk/VB in/IN a/AT foul-smelling/JJ hole/NN ?/. ?/.

He/PPS grew/VBD annoyed/VBN and/CC at/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN surprised/VBN at/IN that/DT emotion/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ conscious/JJ of/IN a/AT growing/VBG sense/NN of/IN absurdity/NN ./.

Hillman/NP had/HVD written/VBN it/PPO all/ABN out/RP ,/, hadn't/HVD* he/PPS ?/. ?/.

Wasn't/BEDZ* the/AT report/NN official/JJ enough/QLP ?/. ?/.

What/WDT did/DOD he/PPS hope/VB to/TO accomplish/VB here/RB ?/. ?/.

Hillman/NP had/HVD ordered/VBN him/PPO not/* to/TO leave/VB the/AT far/JJ bank/NN ./.

Prompted/VBN by/IN a/AT guilty/JJ urge/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD disobeyed/VBN the/AT order/NN of/IN a/AT man/NN he/PPS respected/VBD ./.

For/IN what/WDT ?/. ?/.

To/TO tell/VB John/NP something/PN he/PPS would/MD find/VB out/RP for/IN himself/PPL ./.

The/AT figure/NN in/IN the/AT corner/NN belched/VBD loudly/RB ,/, a/AT deep/JJ ,/, liquid/NN eruption/NN ./.

Watson/NP snorted/VBD and/CC then/RB laughed/VBD aloud/RB ./.

Exactly/RB !/. !/.

The/AT soldier's/NN$ voice/NN was/BEDZ muffled/VBN again/RB ,/, stricken/VBN with/IN chagrin/NN ./.

He/PPS clutched/VBD the/AT staff/NN ,/, and/CC his/PP$ dark/JJ eyes/NNS blinked/VBD apologetically/RB ./.

--/-- 'scuse/VB me/PPO ,/, sir/NN ./.

--/-- Let's/VB+PPO get/VB out/IN of/IN here/RB ./.

Watson/NP ran/VBD up/IN the/AT ladder/NN and/CC stood/VBD for/IN a/AT second/OD sucking/VBG in/IN the/AT cool/JJ air/NN that/WPS smelled/VBD of/IN mud/NN and/CC river/NN weeds/NNS ./.

To/IN his/PP$ left/NR ,/, the/AT two/CD skiffs/NNS dented/VBD their/PP$ sharp/JJ bows/NNS into/IN the/AT soft/JJ bank/NN ./.

The/AT flat-bottomed/JJ boat/NN swung/VBD slowly/RB to/IN the/AT pull/NN of/IN the/AT current/NN ./.

A/AT soldier/NN held/VBD the/AT end/NN of/IN a/AT frayed/VBN rope/NN ./.

Three/CD Union/NN guards/NNS appeared/VBD ,/, carrying/VBG their/PP$ rifles/NNS at/IN ready/JJ ./.

Watson/NP stared/VBD at/IN them/PPO curiously/RB ./.

They/PPSS were/BED stocky/JJ men/NNS ,/, well/RB fed/VBN and/CC clean-shaven/JJ ,/, with/IN neat/JJ uniforms/NNS and/CC sturdy/JJ boots/NNS ./.

Behind/IN them/PPO shambled/VBN a/AT long/JJ column/NN of/IN weak/JJ ,/, tattered/VBN men/NNS ./.

The/AT thin/JJ gray/JJ figures/NNS raised/VBD a/AT hoarse/JJ ,/, cawing/VBG cry/NN like/CS the/AT call/NN of/IN a/AT bird/NN flock/NN ./.

They/PPSS moved/VBD toward/IN the/AT skiffs/NNS with/IN shocking/JJ eagerness/NN ,/, elbowing/VBG and/CC shoving/VBG ./.

Four/CD men/NNS were/BED knocked/VBN down/RP ,/, but/CC did/DOD not/* attempt/VB to/TO rise/VB ./.

They/PPSS crept/VBD down/IN the/AT muddy/JJ slope/NN toward/IN the/AT waiting/VBG boats/NNS ./.

The/AT Union/NN soldiers/NNS grounded/VBD arms/NNS and/CC settled/VBD into/IN healthy/JJ ,/, indifferent/JJ postures/NNS to/TO watch/VB the/AT feeble/JJ boarding/NN of/IN the/AT skiffs/NNS ./.

The/AT crawling/VBG men/NNS tried/VBD to/TO rise/VB and/CC fell/VBD again/RB ./.

No/AT one/PN moved/VBD to/IN them/PPO ./.

Watson/NP watched/VBD two/CD of/IN them/PPO flounder/VB into/IN the/AT shallow/JJ water/NN and/CC listened/VBD to/IN their/PP$ voices/NNS beg/VB shrilly/RB ./.

In/IN a/AT confused/VBN ,/, soaked/VBN and/CC stumbling/VBG shift/NN of/IN bodies/NNS and/CC lifting/VBG arms/NNS ,/, the/AT two/CD men/NNS were/BED dragged/VBN into/IN the/AT same/AP skiff/NN ./.

The/AT third/OD crawling/VBG man/NN forced/VBD himself/PPL erect/JJ ./.

He/PPS swayed/VBD like/CS a/AT drunkard/NN ,/, his/PP$ arms/NNS milling/VBG in/IN slow/JJ circles/NNS ./.

He/PPS paced/VBD forward/RB unsteadily/RB ,/, leaning/VBG too/QL far/QL back/RB ,/, his/PP$ head/NN tilted/VBD oddly/RB ./.

His/PP$ steps/NNS were/BED short/JJ and/CC stiff/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, with/IN his/PP$ head/NN thrown/VBN back/RB ,/, his/PP$ progress/NN was/BEDZ a/AT supercilious/JJ strut/NN ./.

He/PPS appeared/VBD to/TO be/BE peering/VBG haughtily/RB down/IN his/PP$ nose/NN at/IN the/AT crowded/VBN and/CC unclean/JJ vessel/NN that/DT would/MD carry/VB him/PPO to/IN freedom/NN ./.

He/PPS stalked/VBD into/IN the/AT water/NN and/CC fell/VBD heavily/RB over/IN the/AT side/NN of/IN the/AT flat-bottomed/JJ barge/NN ,/, his/PP$ weight/NN nearly/RB swamping/VBG the/AT craft/NN ./.

Watson/NP looked/VBD for/IN the/AT fourth/OD man/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD reached/VBN the/AT three/CD passive/JJ guards/NNS ;/. ;/.

he/PPS crept/VBD in/IN an/AT incertain/JJ manner/NN ,/, patting/VBG the/AT ground/NN before/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT guards/NNS did/DOD not/* look/VB at/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT figure/NN on/IN the/AT earth/NN halted/VBD ,/, seemingly/RB bewildered/VBN ./.

He/PPS sank/VBD back/RB on/IN his/PP$ thin/JJ haunches/NNS like/CS a/AT weary/JJ hound/NN ./.

Then/RB he/PPS began/VBD to/TO crawl/VB again/RB ./.

Watson/NP watched/VBD the/AT creeping/VBG figure/NN ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD a/AT spectator/NN interest/NN ./.

Would/MD the/AT man/NN make/VB it/PPO or/CC not/* ?/. ?/.

If/CS only/RB there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT clock/NN for/IN him/PPO to/TO crawl/VB against/IN ./.

If/CS he/PPS failed/VBD to/TO reach/VB the/AT riverbank/NN in/IN five/CD minutes/NNS ,/, say/VB ,/, then/RB the/AT skiffs/NNS would/MD pull/VB away/RB and/CC leave/VB him/PPO groping/VBG in/IN the/AT mud/NN ./.

Say/VB three/CD minutes/NNS to/TO make/VB it/PPO sporting/VBG ./.

Still/RB the/AT guards/NNS did/DOD not/* move/VB ,/, but/CC stood/VBD inert/JJ ,/, aloof/JJ from/IN the/AT slow-scrambling/JJ man/NN ./.

The/AT figure/NN halted/VBD ,/, and/CC Watson/NP gasped/VBD ./.

The/AT man/NN began/VBD to/TO creep/VB in/IN the/AT wrong/JJ direction/NN ,/, deceived/VBN by/IN a/AT slight/JJ rise/NN in/IN the/AT ground/NN !/. !/.

He/PPS turned/VBD slowly/RB and/CC began/VBD to/TO crawl/VB back/RB up/IN the/AT bank/NN toward/IN the/AT rampart/NN ./.

Watson/NP raced/VBD for/IN him/PPO ,/, his/PP$ boots/NNS slamming/VBG the/AT soft/JJ earth/NN ./.

The/AT guards/NNS came/VBD to/IN life/NN with/IN astonishing/JJ menace/NN ./.

They/PPSS spun/VBD and/CC flung/VBD their/PP$ rifles/NNS up/RP ./.

Watson/NP gesticulated/VBD wildly/RB ./.

One/CD man/NN dropped/VBD to/IN his/PP$ knee/NN for/IN better/JJR aim/NN ./.

--/-- Let/VB me/PPO help/VB him/PPO ,/, for/IN the/AT love/NN of/IN God/NP !/. !/.

The/AT guards/NNS lowered/VBD their/PP$ rifles/NNS and/CC their/PP$ rifles/NNS and/CC peered/VBD at/IN Watson/NP with/IN sullen/JJ ,/, puzzled/VBN faces/NNS ./.

Watson/NP pounded/VBD to/IN the/AT crawling/VBG man/NN and/CC stopped/VBD ,/, panting/VBG heavily/RB ./.

He/PPS reached/VBD down/RP and/CC closed/VBD his/PP$ fingers/NNS on/IN the/AT man's/NN$ upper/JJ arm/NN ./.

Beneath/IN his/PP$ clutch/NN ,/, a/AT flat/JJ strip/NN of/IN muscle/NN surged/VBD on/IN the/AT bone/NN ./.

Watson/NP bent/VBD awkwardly/RB and/CC lifted/VBD the/AT man/NN to/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS ./.

Watson/NP stared/VBD into/IN a/AT cadaverous/JJ face/NN ./.

Two/CD clotted/VBN balls/NNS the/AT color/NN of/IN mucus/NN rolled/VBD between/IN fiery/JJ lids/NNS ./.

Light/JJ sticks/NNS of/IN fingers/NNS ,/, the/AT tips/NNS gummy/JJ with/IN dark/JJ earth/NN ,/, patted/VBD at/IN Watson's/NP$ throat/NN ./.

The/AT man's/NN$ voice/NN was/BEDZ a/AT sweet/JJ ,/, patient/JJ whisper/NN ./.

--/-- Henry/NP said/VBD that/CS he'd/PPS+MD take/VB my/PP$ arm/NN and/CC get/VB me/PPO right/QL there/RB ./.

How/WRB far/RB could/MD it/PPO be/BE ,/, Watson/NP thought/VBD bleakly/RB ,/, how/WRB far/RB can/MD a/AT blind/JJ man/NN crawl/VB ?/. ?/.

--/-- Why/WRB ,/, course/NN I/PPSS can/MD ./.

I/PPSS can/MD walk/VB real/QL good/JJ ./.

Watson/NP stumbled/VBD down/IN the/AT bank/NN ./.

The/AT man/NN leaned/VBD his/PP$ frail/JJ body/NN against/IN Watson's/NP$ shoulder/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ no/AT heavier/JJR than/CS a/AT child/NN ./.

Watson/NP paused/VBD for/IN breath/NN ./.

The/AT man/NN wheezed/VBD weakly/RB ,/, his/PP$ fetid/JJ breath/NN beating/VBG softly/RB against/IN Watson's/NP$ neck/NN ./.

His/PP$ sweet/JJ whisper/NN came/VBD after/IN great/JJ effort/NN ./.

--/-- Oh/UH ,/, Christ/UH ./.

Watson/NP supported/VBD the/AT man/NN to/IN the/AT edge/NN of/IN the/AT bank/NN and/CC passed/VBD the/AT frail/JJ figure/NN over/IN the/AT bow/NN of/IN the/AT nearest/JJT skiff/NN ./.

The/AT man/NN swayed/VBD on/IN a/AT thwart/NN ,/, turning/VBG his/PP$ ruined/VBN eyes/NNS from/IN side/NN to/IN side/NN ./.

Watson/NP turned/VBD away/RB ,/, sickened/VBN for/IN the/AT first/OD time/NN in/IN many/AP months/NNS ./.

--/-- Henry/NP ?/. ?/.

The/AT men/NNS mewed/VBD and/CC scratched/VBD ,/, begging/VBG to/TO be/BE taken/VBN away/RB ./.

--/-- Goddamn/VB you/PPO !/. !/.

This/DT air/NN of/IN disengagement/NN carried/VBD over/RP to/IN his/PP$ apparent/JJ attitude/NN toward/IN his/PP$ things/NNS ,/, and/CC people/NNS often/RB mistook/VBD it/PPO for/IN boredom/NN in/IN him/PPO or/CC a/AT surrender/NN to/IN repetitious/JJ routine/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ forty-nine/CD at/IN this/DT time/NN ,/, a/AT lanky/JJ woman/NN of/IN breeding/VBG with/IN an/AT austere/JJ ,/, narrow/JJ face/NN which/WDT had/HVD the/AT distinction/NN of/IN a/AT steeple/NN or/CC some/DTI architecture/NN that/DT had/HVD been/BEN designed/VBN long/JJ ago/RB for/IN a/AT stubborn/JJ sort/NN of/IN prayer/NN ./.

She/PPS even/RB spoke/VBD differently/RB when/WRB she/PPS was/BEDZ clean/JJ ,/, and/CC she/PPS was/BEDZ clean/JJ now/RB for/IN his/PP$ departure/NN and/CC her/PP$ voice/NN clear/JJ and/CC rather/QL sharp/JJ ./.

She/PPS stood/VBD clutching/VBG her/PP$ shawl/NN around/IN her/PP$ shoulders/NNS until/CS he/PPS had/HVD swung/VBN the/AT car/NN onto/IN the/AT road/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, when/WRB he/PPS had/HVD it/PPO pointed/VBN down/IN the/AT hill/NN ,/, he/PPS stopped/VBD to/TO gaze/VB at/IN her/PPO through/IN the/AT window/NN ./.

Once/RB more/RBR and/CC roared/VBD off/RP into/IN the/AT fog/NN ,/, his/PP$ foot/NN evidently/RB surprising/VBG him/PPO with/IN the/AT suddenness/NN with/IN which/WDT it/PPS pressed/VBD the/AT accelerator/NN ,/, just/RB as/CS his/PP$ hand/NN did/DOD when/WRB he/PPS worked/VBD ./.

She/PPS walked/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT house/NN and/CC entered/VBD ,/, feeling/VBG herself/PPL returning/VBG ,/, sensing/VBG some/DTI kind/NN of/IN opportunity/NN in/IN the/AT empty/JJ building/NN ./.

There/EX is/BEZ a/AT death/NN in/IN all/ABN partings/NNS ,/, she/PPS knew/VBD ,/, and/CC promptly/RB put/VBD it/PPO out/IN of/IN her/PP$ mind/NN ./.

Every/AT few/AP minutes/NNS she/PPS would/MD awaken/VB for/IN a/AT moment/NN to/TO review/VB things/NNS :/: Stowey/NP ,/, yes/RB ,/, was/BEDZ on/IN his/PP$ way/NN south/NR ,/, and/CC the/AT two/CD boys/NNS were/BED away/RB in/IN school/NN ,/, and/CC nothing/PN was/BEDZ burning/VBG on/IN the/AT stove/NN ,/, and/CC Lucretia/NP was/BEDZ coming/VBG for/IN dinner/NN and/CC bringing/VBG three/CD guests/NNS of/IN hers/PP$$ ./.

Then/RB she/PPS fell/VBD asleep/RB again/RB as/QL soddenly/RB as/CS a/AT person/NN with/IN fever/NN ,/, and/CC when/WRB she/PPS awoke/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ dark/JJ outside/RB and/CC the/AT clarity/NN was/BEDZ back/RB in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS ./.

She/PPS stood/VBD up/RP ,/, smoothing/VBG her/PP$ hair/NN down/RP ,/, straightening/VBG her/PP$ clothes/NNS ,/, feeling/VBG a/AT thankfulness/NN for/IN the/AT enveloping/VBG darkness/NN outside/RB ,/, and/CC ,/, above/IN everything/PN else/RB ,/, for/IN the/AT absence/NN of/IN the/AT need/NN to/TO answer/VB ,/, to/TO respond/VB ,/, to/TO be/BE aware/JJ even/RB of/IN Stowey/NP coming/VBG in/RP or/CC going/VBG out/RP ,/, and/CC yet/RB ,/, now/RB that/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ beginning/VBG to/TO cook/VB ,/, she/PPS glimpsed/VBD a/AT future/NN without/IN him/PPO ,/, a/AT future/NN alone/RB like/CS this/DT ,/, and/CC the/AT pain/NN made/VBD her/PP$ head/NN writhe/VB ,/, and/CC in/IN a/AT moment/NN she/PPS found/VBD it/PPO hard/JJ to/TO wait/VB for/IN Lucretia/NP to/TO come/VB with/IN her/PP$ guests/NNS ./.

She/PPS went/VBD into/IN the/AT living/VBG room/NN and/CC turned/VBD on/RP three/CD lamps/NNS ,/, then/RB back/RB into/IN the/AT kitchen/NN where/WRB she/PPS turned/VBD on/RP the/AT ceiling/NN light/NN and/CC the/AT switch/NN that/WPS lit/VBD the/AT floods/NNS on/IN the/AT barn/NN ,/, illuminating/VBG the/AT driveway/NN ./.

She/PPS knew/VBD she/PPS was/BEDZ feeling/VBG afraid/JJ and/CC inwardly/RB laughed/VBD at/IN herself/PPL ./.

They/PPSS were/BED both/ABX so/QL young/JJ ,/, after/IN all/ABN ,/, so/QL unready/JJ for/IN any/DTI final/JJ parting/NN ./.

How/WRB could/MD it/PPO have/HV been/BEN thirty/CD years/NNS already/RB ,/, she/PPS wondered/VBD ?/. ?/.

She/PPS stood/VBD still/RB over/IN the/AT leg/NN of/IN lamb/NN ,/, rubbing/VBG herbs/NNS into/IN it/PPO ,/, quite/QL suddenly/RB conscious/JJ of/IN a/AT nausea/NN in/IN her/PP$ stomach/NN and/CC a/AT feeling/NN of/IN wrath/NN ,/, a/AT sensation/NN of/IN violence/NN that/WPS started/VBD her/PPO shivering/VBG ./.

But/CC they/PPSS all/ABN said/VBD ,/, ``/`` No/RB ,/, your/PP$ time/NN will/MD come/VB ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT room/NN for/IN company/NN in/IN the/AT tiny/JJ Weaning/VBG House/NN (/( where/WRB the/AT Albright/NP boys/NNS always/RB took/VBD their/PP$ brides/NNS ,/, till/CS they/PPSS could/MD get/VB a/AT house/NN and/CC a/AT farm/NN of/IN their/PP$ own/JJ )/) ./.

So/RB when/WRB the/AT Big/JJ House/NN filled/VBD up/RP and/CC ran/VBD over/RP ,/, the/AT sisters-in-law/NNS found/VBD beds/NNS for/IN everyone/PN in/IN their/PP$ own/JJ homes/NNS ./.

And/CC there/EX was/BEDZ still/RB not/* anything/PN that/CS Linda/NP Kay/NP could/MD do/DO ./.

So/RB Linda/NP Kay/NP gave/VBD up/RP asking/VBG ,/, and/CC accepted/VBD her/PP$ reprieve/NN ./.

Without/IN saying/VBG so/RB ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ really/QL grateful/JJ ;/. ;/.

for/CS to/TO attend/VB the/AT dying/NN was/BEDZ something/PN she/PPS had/HVD never/RB experienced/VBN ,/, and/CC certainly/RB had/HVD not/* imagined/VBN when/WRB she/PPS thought/VBD of/IN the/AT duties/NNS she/PPS would/MD have/HV as/CS Bobby/NP Joe's/NP$ wife/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD made/VBN curtains/NNS for/IN all/ABN the/AT windows/NNS of/IN her/PP$ little/JJ house/NN ,/, and/CC she/PPS had/HVD kept/VBN it/PPO spotless/JJ and/CC neat/JJ ,/, shabby/JJ as/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, and/CC cooked/VBD good/JJ meals/NNS for/IN Bobby/NP Joe/NP ./.

She/PPS had/HVD done/VBN all/ABN the/AT things/NNS she/PPS had/HVD promised/VBN herself/PPL she/PPS would/MD do/DO ,/, but/CC she/PPS had/HVD not/* thought/VBN of/IN this/DT ./.

People/NNS died/VBD ,/, she/PPS would/MD have/HV said/VBN ,/, in/IN hospitals/NNS ,/, or/CC in/IN cars/NNS on/IN the/AT highway/NN at/IN night/NN ./.

Bobby/NP Joe/NP was/BEDZ gone/VBN all/ABN day/NN now/RB ,/, not/* coming/VBG in/RP for/IN dinner/NN and/CC sometimes/RB not/* for/IN supper/NN ./.

When/WRB they/PPSS first/RB married/VBD he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN working/VBG in/IN the/AT fields/NNS all/ABN day/NN ,/, and/CC she/PPS would/MD get/VB in/IN the/AT car/NN and/CC drive/VB to/TO wherever/WRB he/PPS was/BEDZ working/VBG ,/, to/TO take/VB him/PPO a/AT fresh/JJ hot/JJ meal/NN ./.

Four/CD or/CC five/CD of/IN the/AT cousins/NNS from/IN East/JJ Texas/NP were/BED about/RB his/PP$ age/NN ,/, so/RB naturally/RB they/PPSS ran/VBD around/RB together/RB ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT reason/NN for/IN her/PPO to/TO ask/VB what/WDT they/PPSS did/DOD ./.

Thus/RB a/AT new/JJ pattern/NN of/IN days/NNS began/VBD to/TO develop/VB ,/, for/CS Granny/NP Albright/NP did/DOD not/* die/VB ./.

She/PPS lay/VBD still/RB on/IN the/AT bed/NN ,/, her/PP$ head/NN hardly/RB denting/VBG the/AT pillow/NN ;/. ;/.

sometimes/RB she/PPS opened/VBD her/PP$ eyes/NNS and/CC looked/VBD around/RB ,/, and/CC sometimes/RB she/PPS took/VBD a/AT little/AP milk/NN or/CC soup/NN ./.

They/PPSS stopped/VBD expecting/VBG her/PPO to/TO die/VB the/AT next/AP minute/NN ,/, but/CC only/RB in/IN the/AT next/AP day/NN or/CC two/CD ./.

Those/DTS who/WPS had/HVD driven/VBN hundreds/NNS of/IN miles/NNS for/IN the/AT burial/NN would/MD not/* go/VB home/NR ,/, for/CS she/PPS might/MD die/VB any/DTI time/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT night/NN after/IN reading/VBG her/PP$ letter/NN about/IN her/PP$ surgeon/NN uncle/NN --/-- it/PPS must/MD have/HV been/BEN late/RB in/IN September/NP --/-- I/PPSS had/HVD a/AT vision/NN of/IN myself/PPL returned/VBN in/IN ragged/JJ uniform/NN from/IN The/AT Front/NN ,/, nearly/RB dying/VBG ,/, my/PP$ head/NN bandaged/VBN and/CC blooded/VBN ,/, and/CC Jessica/NP bending/VBG over/IN me/PPO ,/, the/AT power/NN of/IN her/PP$ love/NN bringing/VBG me/PPO back/RB to/IN life/NN ./.

For/IN many/AP nights/NNS afterward/RB ,/, the/AT idea/NN of/IN her/PPO having/HVG been/BEN so/QL close/JJ to/IN me/PPO in/IN that/DT imagined/VBN bed/NN would/MD return/VB and/CC fill/VB me/PPO with/IN obscure/JJ and/CC painful/JJ desires/NNS ,/, would/MD cause/VB me/PPO to/TO lie/VB awake/RB in/IN shame/NN ,/, tossing/VBG with/IN irresolution/NN ,/, longing/VBG to/TO fall/VB into/IN a/AT deep/JJ sleep/NN ./.

The/AT weeks/NNS went/VBD by/RB ,/, and/CC the/AT longer/JJR our/PP$ separation/NN grew/VBD ,/, the/AT more/QL unbounded/JJ and/CC almost/RB unbearable/JJ my/PP$ fantasies/NNS became/VBD ./.

They/PPSS caused/VBD my/PP$ love/NN for/IN Jessica/NP to/TO become/VB warmer/JJR and/CC at/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN more/QL hopeless/JJ ,/, as/CS if/CS my/PP$ adolescent/NN self/NN knew/VBD that/WPS only/RB torment/NN would/MD ever/RB bring/VB me/PPO the/AT courage/NN to/TO ask/VB to/TO see/VB her/PPO again/RB ./.

As/CS it/PPS turned/VBD out/RP ,/, Jessica/NP took/VBD matters/NNS into/IN her/PP$ own/JJ hands/NNS ./.

Having/HVG received/VBN permission/NN to/TO give/VB a/AT camp/NN reunion-Halloween/NP party/NN ,/, she/PPS asked/VBD that/CS I/PPSS come/VB and/CC be/BE her/PP$ date/NN ./.

I/PPSS went/VBD and/CC ,/, mum/JJ and/CC nervous/JJ ,/, all/ABN but/IN made/VBN a/AT fool/NN of/IN myself/PPL ./.

Again/RB among/IN those/DTS jubilantly/RB reunited/VBN bunkmates/NNS ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ shy/JJ with/IN Jessie/NP and/CC acted/VBD as/CS I/PPSS had/HVD during/IN those/DTS early/JJ Saturday/NR mornings/NNS when/WRB we/PPSS all/ABN seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE playing/VBG for/IN effect/NN ,/, to/TO be/BE detached/VBN and/CC unconcerned/JJ with/IN the/AT girls/NNS who/WPS were/BED properly/RB our/PP$ dates/NNS but/IN about/IN whom/WPO ,/, later/RBR ,/, in/IN the/AT privacy/NN of/IN our/PP$ bunks/NNS ,/, we/PPSS would/MD think/VB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/AT most/RBT elaborate/JJ romance/NN ./.

I/PPSS remember/VB standing/VBG in/IN a/AT corner/NN ,/, watching/VBG Jessica/NP act/VB the/AT hostess/NN ,/, serving/VBG soft/JJ drinks/NNS to/IN her/PP$ guests/NNS ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ wearing/VBG her/PP$ dark/JJ hair/NN in/IN two/CD ,/, thick/JJ braids/NNS to/TO attain/VB an/AT ``/`` American/JJ Girl/NN ''/'' effect/NN she/PPS thought/VBD was/BEDZ appropriate/JJ to/IN Halloween/NP ./.

It/PPS made/VBD her/PPO look/VB sweet/JJ and/CC schoolgirlish/JJ ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ excited/VBN to/TO be/BE with/IN her/PPO ,/, but/CC I/PPSS did/DOD not/* know/VB how/WRB to/TO express/VB it/PPO ./.

Yet/RB a/AT moment/NN did/DOD come/VB that/DT night/NN when/WRB the/AT adventurous/JJ letter/NN writer/NN and/CC fantasist/NN seemed/VBD to/TO stride/VB off/RP my/PP$ flashy/JJ pages/NNS ,/, out/IN of/IN my/PP$ mind/NN ,/, and/CC plant/VB himself/PPL in/IN reality/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ late/JJ ,/, we/PPSS were/BED playing/VBG kissing/VBG games/NNS ,/, and/CC Jessica/NP and/CC I/PPSS were/BED called/VBN on/RP to/TO kiss/VB in/IN front/NN of/IN the/AT others/NNS ./.

We/PPSS blushed/VBD and/CC were/BED flustered/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PPS turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/BE the/AT fleetest/JJT brush/NN of/IN lips/NNS upon/IN cheek/NN ./.

The/AT kiss/NN outraged/VBD our/PP$ friends/NNS but/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ done/VBN and/CC meanwhile/RB had/HVD released/VBN in/IN me/PPO all/ABN the/AT remote/JJ ,/, exciting/JJ premonitions/NNS of/IN lust/NN ,/, all/ABN the/AT mysterious/JJ sensations/NNS that/CS I/PPSS had/HVD imagined/VBN a/AT truly/RB consummated/VBN kiss/NN would/MD convey/VB to/IN me/PPO ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ at/IN that/DT party/NN that/WPS ,/, finally/RB overcoming/VBG my/PP$ timidity/NN ,/, inspired/VBD by/IN tales/NNS only/RB half-understood/VBN and/CC overheard/VBN among/IN older/JJR boys/NNS ,/, I/PPSS asked/VBD Jessie/NP to/TO spend/VB New/JJ Year's/NN$ Eve/NN with/IN me/PPO ./.

Lovingly/RB ,/, she/PPS accepted/VBD ,/, and/CC so/QL great/JJ was/BEDZ my/PP$ emotion/NN that/CS all/ABN I/PPSS could/MD think/VB of/IN saying/VBG was/BEDZ ,/, ``/`` You're/PPSS+BER amazing/JJ ,/, you/PPSS know/VB ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Later/RBR ,/, we/PPSS agreed/VBD to/TO think/VB of/IN how/WRB we/PPSS wished/VBD to/TO spend/VB that/DT night/NN ./.

We/PPSS would/MD write/VB to/IN one/CD another/DT and/CC make/VB a/AT definite/JJ plan/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ terribly/RB pleased/VBN ./.

Among/IN my/PP$ school/NN and/CC neighborhood/NN friends/NNS ,/, during/IN the/AT next/AP months/NNS ,/, I/PPSS bragged/VBD and/CC swaggered/VBD and/CC pompously/RB described/VBD my/PP$ impending/VBG date/NN ./.

But/CC though/CS I/PPSS boasted/VBD and/CC gave/VBD off/RP a/AT dapper/JJ front/NN ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ beneath/IN it/PPO all/ABN frightened/VBN ./.

It/PPS would/MD be/BE the/AT first/OD time/NN I/PPSS had/HVD ever/RB been/BEN completely/RB alone/RB with/IN a/AT girl/NN I/PPSS loved/VBD ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD no/AT idea/NN of/IN what/WDT subjects/NNS one/PN discussed/VBD when/WRB alone/RB with/IN a/AT girl/NN ,/, or/CC how/WRB one/PN behaved/VBD :/: Should/MD I/PPSS hold/VB her/PPO hand/NN while/CS walking/VBG or/CC only/RB when/WRB crossing/VBG the/AT street/NN ?/. ?/.

Should/MD I/PPSS bring/VB along/RB a/AT corsage/NN or/CC send/VB one/PN to/IN her/PPO ?/. ?/.

All/QL this/DT was/BEDZ unknown/JJ to/IN me/PPO ,/, and/CC yet/RB I/PPSS had/HVD dared/VBN to/TO ask/VB her/PPO out/RP for/IN the/AT most/QL important/JJ night/NN of/IN the/AT year/NN !/. !/.

When/WRB in/IN one/CD letter/NN Jessica/NP informed/VBD me/PPO that/CS her/PP$ father/NN did/DOD not/* like/VB the/AT idea/NN of/IN her/PPO going/VBG out/RP alone/RB on/IN New/JJ Year's/NN$ Eve/NN ,/, I/PPSS knew/VBD for/IN a/AT moment/NN an/AT immense/JJ relief/NN ;/. ;/.

Her/PP$ optimism/NN gave/VBD me/PPO heart/NN ./.

I/PPSS forced/VBD confidence/NN into/IN myself/PPL ./.

I/PPSS made/VBD inquiries/NNS ,/, I/PPSS read/VBD a/AT book/NN of/IN etiquette/NN ./.

In/IN December/NP I/PPSS wrote/VBD her/PPO with/IN authority/NN that/CS we/PPSS would/MD meet/VB on/IN the/AT steps/NNS of/IN the/AT Hotel/NN Astor/NP ,/, a/AT rendezvous/NN spot/NN that/CS I/PPSS had/HVD learned/VBN was/BEDZ the/AT most/QL sophisticated/JJ ./.

I/PPSS set/VB the/AT hour/NN of/IN our/PP$ meeting/NN for/IN seven/CD ./.

At/IN five/CD o'clock/RB that/DT night/NN it/PPS was/BEDZ already/RB dark/JJ ,/, and/CC behind/IN my/PP$ closed/VBN door/NN I/PPSS was/BEDZ dressing/VBG as/QL carefully/RB as/CS a/AT groom/NN ./.

I/PPSS wore/VBD a/AT new/JJ double-breasted/JJ brown/JJ worsted/NN suit/NN with/IN a/AT faint/JJ herringbone/NN design/NN and/CC wide/JJ lapels/NNS like/CS a/AT devil's/NN$ ears/NNS ./.

My/PP$ camp-made/JJ leather/NN wallet/NN ,/, bulky/JJ with/IN twisted/VBN ,/, raised/VBN stitches/NNS around/IN the/AT edges/NNS ,/, I/PPSS stuffed/VBD with/IN money/NN I/PPSS had/HVD been/BEN saving/VBG ./.

Hatless/JJ ,/, in/IN an/AT overcoat/NN of/IN rough/JJ blue/JJ wool/NN ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ given/VBN a/AT proud/JJ farewell/NN by/IN my/PP$ mother/NN and/CC father/NN ,/, and/CC I/PPSS set/VBD out/RP into/IN the/AT strangely/RB still/JJ streets/NNS of/IN Brooklyn/NP ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD superior/JJ to/IN the/AT neighborhood/NN friends/NNS I/PPSS was/BEDZ leaving/VBG behind/RB ,/, felt/VBD older/JJR than/CS my/PP$ years/NNS ,/, and/CC was/BEDZ full/JJ of/IN compliments/NNS for/IN myself/PPL as/CS I/PPSS headed/VBD into/IN the/AT subway/NN that/WPS was/BEDZ carrying/VBG its/PP$ packs/NNS of/IN passengers/NNS out/IN of/IN that/DT dull/JJ borough/NN and/CC into/IN the/AT unstable/JJ ,/, tantalizing/VBG excitement/NN of/IN Manhattan/NP ./.

Heavy-coated/JJ ,/, severe-looking/JJ policemen/NNS sat/VBD astride/IN noble/JJ horses/NNS along/IN the/AT curbside/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/AT revellers/NNS from/IN spilling/VBG out/RP in/IN front/NN of/IN the/AT crawling/VBG traffic/NN ./.

The/AT night/NN was/BEDZ cold/JJ but/CC the/AT crowd/NN kept/VBD one/PN warm/JJ ./.

The/AT giant/JJ electric/JJ signs/NNS and/CC marquees/NNS were/BED lit/VBN up/RP for/IN the/AT first/OD time/NN since/CS blackout/NN regulations/NNS had/HVD been/BEN instituted/VBN ,/, and/CC the/AT atmosphere/NN was/BEDZ alive/JJ with/IN the/AT feeling/NN that/DT victory/NN was/BEDZ just/RB around/IN the/AT corner/NN ./.

An/AT old/JJ gentlemen/NNS next/IN to/IN me/PPO held/VBN a/AT Boy/NN Scout/NN bugle/NN to/IN his/PP$ lips/NNS and/CC blasted/VBD away/RB at/IN every/AT fourth/OD step/NN and/CC during/IN the/AT interim/NN shouted/VBD out/RP ,/, ``/`` V/NP for/IN Victory/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

I/PPSS looked/VBD over/IN their/PP$ faces/NNS and/CC felt/VBD a/AT twinge/NN :/: they/PPSS all/ABN looked/VBD so/QL much/QL more/QL knowing/JJ than/CS I/PPSS ./.

I/PPSS looked/VBD for/IN Jessica/NP to/TO materialize/VB out/IN of/IN the/AT clogging/VBG ,/, curdling/VBG crowd/NN and/CC ,/, as/CS the/AT time/NN passed/VBD and/CC I/PPSS waited/VBD ,/, a/AT fiend/NN came/VBD to/IN life/NN beside/IN me/PPO and/CC whispered/VBD in/IN my/PP$ ear/NN :/: How/WRB was/BEDZ I/PPSS planning/VBG to/TO greet/VB Jessica/NP ?/. ?/.

I/PPSS felt/VBD for/IN my/PP$ wallet/NN ./.

Whole/JJ platoons/NNS were/BED taking/VBG up/RP new/JJ positions/NNS on/IN the/AT steps/NNS ,/, arriving/VBG and/CC departing/VBG ,/, while/CS I/PPSS stayed/VBD glued/VBN ,/, like/CS a/AT signpost/NN ,/, to/IN one/CD spot/NN ./.

At/IN 7:25/CD two/CD hotel/NN doormen/NNS came/VBD thumping/VBG down/IN the/AT steps/NNS ,/, carrying/VBG a/AT saw-horse/NN to/TO be/BE set/VBN up/RP as/CS a/AT barricade/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/AT haberdashery/NN store/NN window/NN next/IN to/IN the/AT entranceway/NN ,/, and/CC as/CS I/PPSS watched/VBD them/PPO in/IN their/PP$ gaudy/JJ red/JJ coats/NNS that/WPS nearly/RB scraped/VBD the/AT ground/NN ,/, their/PP$ golden/JJ ,/, fringed/VBN epaulets/NNS and/CC spic/JJ ,/, red-visored/JJ caps/NNS ,/, I/PPSS suddenly/RB saw/VBD just/RB over/IN their/PP$ shoulders/NNS Jessica/NP gracefully/RB making/VBG her/PP$ way/NN through/IN the/AT crowd/NN ./.

We/PPSS had/HVD become/VBN good/JJ friends/NNS during/IN my/PP$ stay/NN at/IN Cook/NP County/NN Hospital/NN ./.

By/IN the/AT time/NN I'd/PPSS+HVD made/VBN it/PPO he/PPS was/BEDZ gone/VBN ./.

After/IN a/AT while/NN the/AT signal/NN became/VBD a/AT buzz/NN and/CC I/PPSS knew/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ behind/IN me/PPO ./.

That/WPS meant/VBD he'd/PPS+HVD parked/VBN someplace/RB ./.

I/PPSS made/VBD a/AT big/JJ circle/NN until/CS I/PPSS located/VBD the/AT car/NN parked/VBN at/IN the/AT curb/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN an/AT apartment/NN house/NN ./.

I/PPSS found/VBD a/AT parking/VBG place/NN half/ABN a/AT block/NN away/RB ,/, sat/VBD in/IN the/AT car/NN and/CC waited/VBD ./.

His/PP$ signal/NN was/BEDZ coming/VBG loud/JJ and/CC clear/JJ and/CC then/RB all/ABN of/IN a/AT sudden/NN it/PPS turned/VBD to/IN a/AT buzz/NN ./.

I/PPSS circled/VBD the/AT block/NN and/CC found/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN the/AT parking/VBG lot/NN of/IN a/AT high-class/NN restaurant/NN ./.

I/PPSS sat/VBD where/WRB I/PPSS could/MD watch/VB the/AT exit/NN and/CC realized/VBD I/PPSS was/BEDZ hungry/JJ ./.

I/PPSS sat/VBD there/RB with/IN the/AT faint/JJ odor/NN of/IN charcoal-broiled/JJ steaks/NNS tantalizing/VBG my/PP$ nostrils/NNS and/CC occasionally/RB catching/VBG the/AT aroma/NN of/IN coffee/NN ./.

The/AT card/NN the/AT man/NN I/PPSS was/BEDZ shadowing/VBG had/HVD filled/VBN out/RP was/BEDZ still/RB on/IN the/AT counter/NN ./.

I/PPSS noticed/VBD that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN Unit/NN 12/CD and/CC that/CS he/PPS had/HVD registered/VBN under/IN the/AT name/NN of/IN Oscar/NP L./NP Palmer/NP and/CC wife/NN ,/, giving/VBG a/AT San/NP Francisco/NP address/NN ./.

Ninety-nine/CD times/NNS out/IN of/IN a/AT hundred/CD the/AT motel/NN manager/NN doesn't/DOZ* check/VB the/AT license/NN number/NN on/IN the/AT plates/NNS against/IN the/AT license/NN number/NN the/AT tenant/NN writes/VBZ out/RP ./.

If/CS he/PPS does/DOZ ,/, it's/PPS+BEZ still/RB better/JJR than/CS an/AT even/JJ chance/NN he/PPS won't/MD* notice/VB the/AT transposition/NN of/IN the/AT numbers/NNS ,/, and/CC if/CS he/PPS should/MD notice/VB it/PPO ,/, the/AT thing/NN can/MD be/BE passed/VBN off/RP as/CS an/AT honest/JJ mistake/NN ./.

I/PPSS used/VBD the/AT alias/NN of/IN Robert/NP C./NP Richards/NP ,/, gave/VBD the/AT first/OD three/CD letters/NNS and/CC the/AT first/OD and/CC last/AP figure/NN of/IN the/AT license/NN number/NN on/IN the/AT agency/NN heap/NN ,/, but/CC a/AT couple/NN of/IN phony/JJ numbers/NNS in/IN between/IN ./.

The/AT manager/NN of/IN the/AT motel/NN was/BEDZ a/AT woman/NN who/WPS apparently/RB didn't/DOD* care/VB ./.

I/PPSS took/VBD another/DT sidelong/JJ glance/NN at/IN the/AT other/AP registration/NN card/NN ,/, then/RB took/VBD the/AT key/NN to/IN Unit/NN 13/CD that/CS she/PPS had/HVD given/VBN me/PPO and/CC went/VBD down/RP long/JJ enough/QLP to/TO park/VB the/AT car/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD noticed/VBN a/AT drive-in/NN down/IN the/AT road/NN a/AT quarter/NN of/IN a/AT mile/NN ./.

After/CS he/PPS had/HVD proceeded/VBN a/AT few/AP feet/NNS ,/, he/PPS paused/VBD and/CC turned/VBD up/RP the/AT cuffs/NNS of/IN his/PP$ trousers/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/BED already/RB damp/JJ and/CC mud-caked/JJ ./.

The/AT viscous/JJ mud/NN was/BEDZ ankle-deep/JJ ,/, and/CC in/IN places/NNS great/JJ puddles/NNS spread/VBD across/IN the/AT road/NN and/CC reflected/VBD the/AT murky/JJ light/NN ./.

As/CS he/PPS approached/VBD the/AT first/OD farmhouse/NN ,/, thunder/NN sounded/VBD behind/IN him/PPO again/RB ,/, closer/RBR now/RB and/CC louder/JJR ,/, like/CS a/AT steadily/RB advancing/VBG drum/NN corps/NN ./.

There/EX were/BED several/AP people/NNS on/IN the/AT porch/NN of/IN the/AT farmhouse/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT very/QL old/JJ man/NN and/CC a/AT young/JJ woman/NN and/CC a/AT brood/NN of/IN children/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN toddlers/NNS to/IN teen-agers/NNS ./.

For/IN just/RB an/AT instant/NN he/PPS thought/VBD of/IN appealing/VBG to/IN them/PPO for/IN help/NN ./.

Perhaps/RB they/PPSS had/HVD a/AT car/NN or/CC truck/NN and/CC would/MD drive/VB him/PPO into/IN town/NN ./.

Then/RB he/PPS realized/VBD the/AT utter/JJ futility/NN of/IN the/AT idea/NN ./.

They/PPSS were/BED staring/VBG at/IN him/PPO in/IN the/AT same/AP blank/NN and/CC menacing/VBG way/NN that/CS the/AT men/NNS outside/IN the/AT gate/NN had/HVD stared/VBN ./.

Even/RB the/AT eyes/NNS of/IN the/AT smallest/JJT children/NNS seemed/VBD malicious/JJ ./.

On/IN his/PP$ side/NN of/IN the/AT road/NN there/EX were/BED two/CD farm/NN hands/NNS ,/, well/RB back/RB in/IN a/AT field/NN ,/, leaning/VBG against/IN a/AT plow/NN ./.

They/PPSS ,/, too/RB ,/, stared/VBD at/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT drums/NNS of/IN thunder/NN were/BED right/QL behind/IN him/PPO now/RB ./.

A/AT foolish/JJ thought/NN came/VBD into/IN his/PP$ head/NN ./.

He/PPS remembered/VBD a/AT story/NN he/PPS had/HVD read/VBN as/CS a/AT youth/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ probably/RB one/CD of/IN Kipling's/NP$ tales/NNS of/IN the/AT British/JJ Army/NN ./.

It/PPS concerned/VBD an/AT officer/NN who/WPS had/HVD been/BEN disgraced/VBN and/CC drummed/VBD out/RP ./.

The/AT steady/JJ roll/NN of/IN the/AT drums/NNS had/HVD sounded/VBN behind/IN him/PPO as/CS he/PPS walked/VBD between/IN the/AT endless/JJ ranks/NNS of/IN the/AT men/NNS he/PPS had/HVD commanded/VBN ,/, and/CC each/DT man/NN about-faced/VBD and/CC turned/VBD his/PP$ back/NN as/CS the/AT officer/NN approached/VBD ./.

Marty/NP wished/VBD these/DTS poor/JJ farm/NN people/NNS would/MD turn/VB their/PP$ backs/NNS ./.

The/AT fencing/NN by/IN the/AT roadside/NN ended/VBD ./.

Now/RB the/AT dirt/NN highway/NN was/BEDZ bordered/VBN on/IN either/DTX side/NN by/IN a/AT fairly/QL deep/JJ drainage/NN ditch/NN ,/, too/QL broad/JJ to/TO leap/VB over/RP unless/CS you/PPSS were/BED an/AT Olympic/JJ star/NN ./.

The/AT day's/NN$ rain/NN had/HVD been/BEN added/VBN to/IN the/AT stagnant/JJ water/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ trapped/VBN on/IN the/AT road/NN when/WRB he/PPS heard/VBD the/AT sound/NN of/IN an/AT approaching/VBG car/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ coming/VBG toward/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT car/NN was/BEDZ now/RB in/IN sight/NN ./.

Marty's/NP$ heart/NN skipped/VBD a/AT beat/NN when/WRB he/PPS recognized/VBD it/PPO ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT station/NN wagon/NN that/WPS had/HVD passed/VBN his/PP$ cab/NN on/IN the/AT road/NN ,/, the/AT station/NN wagon/NN that/WPS had/HVD been/BEN parked/VBN at/IN the/AT Burch/NP farm/NN ./.

Acey/NP Squire's/NP$ station/NN wagon/NN ./.

It/PPS had/HVD headed/VBN back/RB toward/IN Jarrodsville/NP ./.

That/WPS had/HVD only/RB been/BEN a/AT ruse/NN to/TO lure/VB him/PPO out/RP on/IN the/AT deserted/VBN road/NN ./.

Now/RB Acey/NP and/CC his/PP$ friends/NNS were/BED returning/VBG to/TO seek/VB him/PPO out/RP ./.

The/AT station/NN wagon/NN came/VBD to/IN a/AT stop/NN a/AT couple/NN of/IN hundred/CD feet/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN him/PPO ,/, beside/IN a/AT fenced/VBN field/NN ./.

Then/RB there/EX was/BEDZ another/DT sound/NN ./.

A/AT second/OD car/NN was/BEDZ coming/VBG from/IN the/AT west/NR ,/, from/IN the/AT direction/NN of/IN Sanford's/NP$ Run/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT Ford/NP that/WPS had/HVD been/BEN outside/IN Burch's/NP$ farm/NN ./.

Marty/NP looked/VBD helplessly/RB in/IN both/ABX directions/NNS ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT narrow/JJ road/NN ,/, barely/RB wide/JJ enough/QLP for/IN two/CD cars/NNS to/TO pass/VB ./.

He/PPS could/MD not/* leave/VB the/AT road/NN because/CS of/IN the/AT water-filled/JJ drainage/NN ditch/NN ./.

When/WRB the/AT two/CD cars/NNS were/BED equidistant/JJ from/IN him/PPO ,/, the/AT station/NN wagon/NN started/VBD up/RP again/RB and/CC the/AT Ford/NP gathered/VBD speed/NN ./.

They/PPSS bore/VBD down/RP on/IN him/PPO ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ nothing/PN he/PPS could/MD do/DO except/IN jump/VB into/IN the/AT ditch/NN ./.

He/PPS jumped/VBD ,/, and/CC sank/VBD to/IN his/PP$ knees/NNS in/IN muddy/JJ water/NN ./.

As/CS the/AT two/CD cars/NNS roared/VBD by/IN ,/, there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT high-pitched/JJ eerie/JJ ,/, nerve-shattering/JJ sound/NN ./.

Marty/NP knew/VBD how/WRB the/AT Union/NN soldiers/NNS must/MD have/HV felt/VBN at/IN Chancellorsville/NP and/CC Antietam/NP and/CC Gettysburg/NP when/WRB the/AT ragged/JJ gray/JJ ranks/NNS charged/VBD at/IN them/PPO ,/, screaming/VBG the/AT wild/JJ banshee/NN howl/NN they/PPSS called/VBD the/AT Rebel/NN yell/NN ./.

For/IN moments/NNS he/PPS stood/VBD in/IN water/NN ,/, shivering/VBG and/CC gasping/VBG for/IN breath/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD turned/VBN his/PP$ ankle/NN slightly/RB ,/, and/CC it/PPS pained/VBD him/PPO ./.

The/AT cars/NNS ,/, with/IN their/PP$ load/NN of/IN howling/VBG men/NNS ,/, had/HVD disappeared/VBN in/IN the/AT distance/NN ./.

There/EX had/HVD been/BEN two/CD more/AP cars/NNS parked/VBN at/IN the/AT farm/NN ,/, a/AT Plymouth/NP and/CC a/AT pickup/NN truck/NN ./.

They/PPSS would/MD be/BE coming/VBG for/IN him/PPO next/RB ,/, bearing/VBG down/RP on/IN him/PPO from/IN both/ABX directions/NNS ./.

And/CC then/RB the/AT station/NN wagon/NN and/CC the/AT Ford/NP would/MD seek/VB him/PPO out/RP again/RB ./.

He/PPS would/MD be/BE harassed/VBN repeatedly/RB and/CC would/MD escape/VB death/NN by/IN inches/NNS time/NN after/IN time/NN ,/, all/ABN the/AT way/NN to/IN Jarrodsville/NP ./.

He/PPS still/RB had/HVD three/CD miles/NNS to/TO go/VB ./.

Back/RB East/NR the/AT more/QL affluent/JJ juvenile/NN delinquents/NNS ,/, who/WPS could/MD afford/VB hyped-up/JJ autos/NNS instead/RB of/IN switch/NN blades/NNS as/CS lethal/JJ weapons/NNS ,/, played/VBD this/DT same/AP game/NN and/CC called/VBD it/PPO ``/`` Chicken/NN ''/'' ./.

He/PPS could/MD not/* go/VB through/IN the/AT fields/NNS ./.

That/DT way/NN was/BEDZ barred/VBN on/IN both/ABX sides/NNS of/IN the/AT road/NN by/IN a/AT high/JJ barbed-wire/NN fence/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD to/TO make/VB for/IN the/AT section/NN of/IN road/NN just/QL ahead/RB that/DT was/BEDZ bordered/VBN by/IN the/AT rail/NN fence/NN ,/, the/AT section/NN by/IN the/AT farmhouse/NN ./.

At/IN least/AP he/PPS could/MD climb/VB up/RP on/IN the/AT fence/NN when/WRB his/PP$ tormenters/NNS roared/VBD by/RB again/RB ./.

The/AT Admassy/NP place/NN could/MD not/* be/BE far/RB now/RB ./.

He/PPS would/MD go/VB in/IN there/RB ,/, climb/VB through/IN the/AT window/NN ,/, and/CC at/IN least/AP be/BE safe/JJ for/IN a/AT little/JJ while/NN and/CC able/JJ to/TO rest/VB ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ even/RB a/AT bare/JJ chance/NN that/CS the/AT phone/NN had/HVD not/* been/BEN disconnected/VBN ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* dare/VB climb/VB back/RB up/RP to/IN the/AT road/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ deep/JJ in/IN water/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN least/AP they/PPSS could/MD not/* reach/VB him/PPO there/RB ./.

He/PPS splashed/VBD on/RP ,/, mud/NN sucking/VBG at/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS with/IN each/DT step/NN ,/, until/CS he/PPS reached/VBD the/AT end/NN of/IN the/AT drainage/NN ditch/NN and/CC the/AT beginning/NN of/IN the/AT fence/NN that/WPS enclosed/VBD the/AT farm/NN ./.

He/PPS climbed/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT road/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS felt/VBD utterly/RB exhausted/VBN ./.

He/PPS stood/VBD ,/, panting/VBG ,/, for/IN a/AT moment/NN ./.

And/CC then/RB he/PPS saw/VBD something/PN that/CS he/PPS had/HVD not/* seen/VBN before/RB ,/, and/CC panic/NN gripped/VBD him/PPO again/RB ./.

The/AT fence/NN ,/, his/PP$ only/AP refuge/NN when/WRB the/AT metal/NN death/NN came/VBD roaring/VBG at/IN him/PPO ,/, was/BEDZ made/VBN of/IN rails/NNS ,/, all/QL right/RB ,/, but/CC the/AT rails/NNS were/BED protected/VBN by/IN a/AT thick/JJ screening/NN of/IN barbed/VBN wire/NN that/WPS would/MD rip/VB his/PP$ flesh/NN if/CS he/PPS pressed/VBD against/IN it/PPO ./.

He/PPS lurched/VBD on/RP down/IN the/AT road/NN despairingly/RB ,/, because/CS there/EX was/BEDZ no/AT place/NN else/RB to/TO go/VB ./.

He/PPS lost/VBD all/ABN sense/NN of/IN dignity/NN ./.

You/PPSS could/MD not/* stand/VB on/IN dignity/NN when/WRB you/PPSS were/BED soaked/VBN and/CC muddied/VBN and/CC your/PP$ life/NN was/BEDZ at/IN stake/NN ./.

Probably/RB people/NNS were/BED watching/VBG him/PPO from/IN the/AT porch/NN or/CC from/IN behind/IN the/AT windows/NNS of/IN this/DT farmhouse/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, but/CC he/PPS did/DOD not/* bother/VB to/TO look/VB ./.

He/PPS broke/VBD into/IN a/AT dogtrot/NN ,/, breathing/VBG heavily/RB ,/, streaming/VBG with/IN sweat/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD to/TO reach/VB Admassy's/NP$ place/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ his/PP$ only/AP sanctuary/NN ./.

The/AT fences/NNS on/IN both/ABX sides/NNS of/IN the/AT road/NN bristled/VBD with/IN the/AT barbed/VBN wire/NN ./.

The/AT fences/NNS stretched/VBD on/RP endlessly/RB ./.

And/CC then/RB he/PPS heard/VBD them/PPO ./.

And/CC now/RB he/PPS saw/VBD them/PPO ./.

The/AT Plymouth/NP was/BEDZ coming/VBG at/IN him/PPO from/IN the/AT east/NR ,/, the/AT pickup/NN truck/NN from/IN the/AT west/NR ./.

They/PPSS had/HVD timed/VBN it/PPO better/RBR this/DT time/NN ./.

They/PPSS would/MD reach/VB him/PPO at/IN almost/RB exactly/RB the/AT same/AP instant/NN ./.

He/PPS stopped/VBD stone-still/JJ ./.

If/CS he/PPS backed/VBD against/IN the/AT fence/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/AT cars/NNS would/MD brush/VB him/PPO as/CS it/PPS passed/VBD ,/, and/CC he/PPS would/MD be/BE cruelly/RB lacerated/VBN by/IN the/AT wire/NN ./.

He/PPS stumbled/VBD to/IN the/AT middle/NN of/IN the/AT road/NN and/CC simply/RB stood/VBD there/RB ,/, waiting/VBG for/IN them/PPO ,/, a/AT perfect/JJ target/NN ./.

The/AT cars/NNS must/MD have/HV had/HVN their/PP$ gas/NN pedals/NNS pushed/VBN down/RP to/IN the/AT floor/NN boards/NNS ./.

They/PPSS were/BED coming/VBG on/RP at/IN reckless/JJ speed/NN for/IN such/JJ old/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

They/PPSS thundered/VBD at/IN him/PPO ./.

He/PPS held/VBD his/PP$ arms/NNS close/RB to/IN his/PP$ sides/NNS and/CC made/VBD himself/PPL as/QL small/JJ as/QL possible/JJ ./.

When/WRB the/AT Plymouth/NP neared/VBD ,/, it/PPS veered/VBD toward/IN him/PPO and/CC seemed/VBD about/RB to/TO run/VB him/PPO down/RP ./.

He/PPS forced/VBD himself/PPL to/TO stay/VB frozen/VBN there/RB ./.

If/CS he/PPS moved/VBD ,/, he/PPS would/MD be/BE in/IN the/AT path/NN of/IN the/AT other/AP car/NN ./.

He/PPS thought/VBD the/AT fender/NN of/IN the/AT Plymouth/NP brushed/VBD his/PP$ jacket/NN as/CS it/PPS went/VBD by/RB ./.

In/IN a/AT fraction/NN of/IN a/AT second/OD the/AT pickup/NN truck/NN hurtled/VBD by/RB on/IN the/AT other/AP side/NN ./.

The/AT weird/JJ ,/, insane/JJ sound/NN of/IN the/AT Rebel/NN yell/NN reverberated/VBD again/RB and/CC echoed/VBD from/IN the/AT distant/JJ hills/NNS ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* leave/VB the/AT middle/NN of/IN the/AT road/NN ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* try/VB to/TO run/VB ./.

He/PPS trudged/VBD on/RP ,/, his/PP$ aching/VBG eyes/NNS focused/VBD straight/RB ahead/RB ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ nearing/VBG the/AT Admassy/NP house/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO make/VB it/PPO ,/, he/PPS told/VBD himself/PPL ./.

And/CC then/RB he/PPS heard/VBD a/AT car/NN coming/VBG from/IN the/AT east/NR ,/, and/CC he/PPS felt/VBD as/CS if/CS he/PPS would/MD break/VB down/RP and/CC weep/VB ./.

``/`` Oh/UH ,/, no/RB ,/, not/* again/RB ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD aloud/RB ./.

``/`` Not/* again/RB so/QL soon/RB ''/'' ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT new/JJ sound/NN ,/, a/AT sound/NN as/CS piercing/VBG as/CS the/AT Rebel/NN yell/NN ,/, yet/RB different/JJ ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT sound/NN of/IN a/AT siren/NN ./.

Now/RB he/PPS saw/VBD that/CS the/AT approaching/VBG car/NN was/BEDZ painted/VBN white/JJ ,/, and/CC he/PPS began/VBD to/TO wave/VB his/PP$ arms/NNS frantically/RB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT prowl/NN car/NN from/IN the/AT sheriff's/NN$ office/NN ./.

The/AT car/NN drew/VBD up/RP alongside/IN him/PPO and/CC stopped/VBD ./.

``/`` Get/VB in/RP ''/'' ,/, Charley/NP Estes/NP said/VBD brusquely/RB ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ someone/PN in/IN front/NN with/IN the/AT sheriff/NN ./.

The/AT sheriff/NN was/BEDZ occupied/VBN with/IN maneuvering/VBG the/AT car/NN around/RB in/IN a/AT very/QL narrow/JJ space/NN ./.

Shayne/NP asked/VBD ,/, peering/VBG ahead/RB at/IN the/AT partially/RB obscured/VBN street/NN sign/NN ./.

Shayne/NP got/VBD in/IN the/AT left-hand/NN lane/NN and/CC cut/VBD across/IN the/AT Boulevard/NN divider/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT small/JJ ,/, neon-lighted/JJ restaurant/NN and/CC cocktail/NN lounge/NN on/IN the/AT southeast/NR corner/NN of/IN the/AT intersection/NN as/CS he/PPS turned/VBD into/IN the/AT quiet/JJ ,/, palm-lined/JJ street/NN where/WRB most/AP of/IN the/AT houses/NNS on/IN both/ABX sides/NNS were/BED older/JJR two-story/JJ mansions/NNS ,/, now/RB cut/VBN up/RP into/IN furnished/VBN rooms/NNS and/CC housekeeping/NN apartments/NNS ./.

A/AT single/AP automobile/NN was/BEDZ parked/VBN half-way/RB up/IN the/AT block/NN on/IN the/AT left-hand/NN side/NN ./.

On/IN this/DT side/NN of/IN the/AT Bay/NN ,/, Miami/NP Beach/NN cops/NNS had/HVD no/AT more/QL legal/JJ rights/NNS than/CS any/DTI ordinary/JJ citizen/NN ,/, and/CC Shayne's/NP$ pistol/NN permit/NN was/BEDZ just/RB as/QL good/JJ as/CS theirs/PP$$ ./.

He/PPS hit/VBD him/PPO once/RB on/IN the/AT sharp/JJ point/NN of/IN his/PP$ chin/NN and/CC felt/VBD the/AT body/NN go/VB limp/JJ ./.

He/PPS dropped/VBD him/PPO into/IN the/AT street/NN a/AT couple/NN of/IN feet/NNS away/RB from/IN Geely's/NP$ recumbent/JJ figure/NN and/CC stared/VBD down/RP at/IN both/ABX of/IN them/PPO for/IN a/AT moment/NN before/IN kicking/VBG the/AT big/JJ man/NN lightly/RB in/IN the/AT side/NN ./.

Mickey's/NP$ guts/NNS twisted/VBD with/IN the/AT effort/NN ,/, but/CC he/PPS kept/VBD his/PP$ eye/NN on/IN the/AT weapon/NN ./.

It/PPS moved/VBD in/IN a/AT silver/NN arc/NN toward/IN his/PP$ throat/NN ,/, then/RB veered/VBD downward/RB ./.

He/PPS hunched/VBD his/PP$ left/JJ shoulder/NN into/IN it/PPO and/CC slashed/VBD at/IN Roberts'/NP$ forearm/NN with/IN his/PP$ own/JJ ,/, felt/VBD the/AT blade/NN slide/VB off/IN his/PP$ sleeve/NN ./.

Before/CS Roberts/NP could/MD move/VB inside/RB to/TO cut/VB upward/RB toward/IN his/PP$ face/NN ,/, he/PPS slammed/VBD his/PP$ right/JJ fist/NN into/IN Roberts'/NP$ belly/NN ./.

Roberts/NP sagged/VBD and/CC slashed/VBD at/IN him/PPO wildly/RB ./.

Ducking/VBG ,/, Mickey/NP tripped/VBD and/CC fell/VBD to/IN one/CD side/NN ,/, landing/VBG heavily/RB on/IN the/AT wood/NN floor/NN ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD it/PPO rip/VB at/IN the/AT side/NN of/IN his/PP$ jacket/NN and/CC a/AT momentary/JJ sting/NN under/IN his/PP$ left/JJ ribs/NNS ./.

He/PPS got/VBD a/AT knee/NN up/RP into/IN Roberts'/NP$ belly/NN ,/, used/VBD both/ABX hands/NNS and/CC heaved/VBD him/PPO clear/JJ ,/, then/RB scrambled/VBD to/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS ./.

Still/RB clutching/VBG the/AT razor/NN ,/, Roberts/NP came/VBD up/RP into/IN a/AT crouch/NN ,/, shaking/VBG his/PP$ head/NN ./.

When/WRB he/PPS charged/VBD Mickey/NP was/BEDZ ready/JJ ./.

He/PPS hit/VBD Roberts/NP with/IN his/PP$ left/JJ fist/NN in/IN the/AT ribs/NNS and/CC the/AT razor/NN cut/VBD toward/IN him/PPO feebly/RB ,/, then/RB wobbled/VBD in/IN mid-air/NN ./.

With/IN his/PP$ right/JJ fist/NN ,/, and/CC nearly/RB all/ABN his/PP$ weight/NN behind/IN it/PPO ,/, he/PPS smashed/VBD at/IN the/AT bloodstained/JJ face/NN ./.

Roberts/NP careened/VBD backward/RB ,/, his/PP$ back/NN arched/VBD ,/, fought/VBD for/IN balance/NN and/CC ,/, failing/VBG ,/, stumbled/VBD against/IN the/AT newel/NN post/NN at/IN the/AT foot/NN of/IN the/AT stairs/NNS ./.

The/AT sound/NN of/IN his/PP$ head/NN striking/VBG the/AT solid/JJ wood/NN was/BEDZ an/AT ultimate/JJ ,/, sudden-end/JJ sound/NN ./.

He/PPS fell/VBD on/IN his/PP$ side/NN across/IN the/AT lowest/JJT step/NN ,/, rolled/VBN over/IN once/RB ,/, then/RB lay/VBD still/RB ./.

Mickey/NP found/VBD himself/PPL leaning/VBG against/IN the/AT desk/NN ,/, with/IN stiff/JJ hands/NNS ,/, panting/VBG for/IN breath/NN ./.

After/IN a/AT minute/NN he/PPS went/VBD to/IN Roberts/NP ,/, looked/VBD at/IN one/CD of/IN his/PP$ eyes/NNS and/CC felt/VBD for/IN a/AT pulse/NN ./.

12/CD

It/PPS seemed/VBD to/IN him/PPO that/CS a/AT long/JJ time/NN had/HVD passed/VBN before/CS he/PPS decided/VBD what/WDT to/TO do/DO ./.

He/PPS looked/VBD at/IN where/WRB Roberts/NP lay/VBD sprawled/VBN on/IN the/AT step/NN ./.

Mickey/NP was/BEDZ sure/JJ now/RB he/PPS was/BEDZ dead/JJ ./.

One/CD thing/NN ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD ,/, nobody/PN knows/VBZ about/IN it/PPO yet/RB ./.

He/PPS climbed/VBD the/AT stairs/NNS ,/, went/VBD into/IN Roberts'/NP$ room/NN ,/, found/VBD a/AT suitcase/NN and/CC packed/VBD as/QL much/AP into/IN it/PPO as/CS he/PPS could/MD ./.

He/PPS left/VBD a/AT few/AP things/NNS ./.

It/PPS didn't/DOD* have/HV to/TO be/BE perfect/JJ ./.

Roberts/NP was/BEDZ a/AT wastrel/NN ./.

Walking/VBG away/RB on/IN impulse/NN ,/, he/PPS might/MD logically/RB leave/VB behind/RB what/WDT it/PPS was/BEDZ inconvenient/JJ to/TO carry/VB ./.

When/WRB he/PPS had/HVD closed/VBN the/AT suitcase/NN he/PPS found/VBD a/AT rag/NN and/CC moved/VBD about/IN the/AT room/NN ,/, wiping/VBG carefully/RB everything/PN he/PPS might/MD have/HV touched/VBN ./.

It/PPS took/VBD him/PPO nearly/RB an/AT hour/NN ./.

He/PPS went/VBD to/IN the/AT room/NN he/PPS had/HVD rented/VBN and/CC got/VBD into/IN his/PP$ overcoat/NN ./.

He/PPS left/VBD the/AT rest/NN of/IN his/PP$ things/NNS and/CC returned/VBD to/IN the/AT lobby/NN ./.

He/PPS set/VBD Roberts'/NP$ suitcase/NN near/IN the/AT front/JJ door/NN ,/, went/VBD outside/RB and/CC walked/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT garage/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ mildly/RB surprised/VBN to/TO find/VB it/PPS was/BEDZ snowing/VBG ./.

It/PPS snowed/VBD softly/RB ,/, silently/RB ,/, an/AT undulating/VBG interruption/NN of/IN his/PP$ vision/NN against/IN the/AT night/NN sky/NN ./.

He/PPS could/MD feel/VB it/PPO on/IN his/PP$ face/NN and/CC in/IN his/PP$ hair/NN ./.

He/PPS found/VBD the/AT key/NN to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN ,/, got/VBD it/PPO started/VBN and/CC warmed/VBD it/PPO up/RP for/IN five/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Then/RB he/PPS backed/VBD out/RP and/CC swung/VBD around/RB to/IN the/AT front/JJ drive/NN ./.

He/PPS went/VBD into/IN the/AT hotel/NN and/CC searched/VBD till/CS he/PPS found/VBD the/AT razor/NN ./.

He/PPS put/VBD it/PPO in/IN his/PP$ own/JJ pocket/NN for/IN safekeeping/JJ ./.

He/PPS took/VBD the/AT suitcase/NN out/RP to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN and/CC put/VBD it/PPO in/IN the/AT front/JJ seat/NN ./.

Then/RB he/PPS went/VBD back/RB for/IN Roberts/NP ./.

The/AT body/NN was/BEDZ heavier/JJR than/CS he/PPS had/HVD anticipated/VBN ./.

He/PPS got/VBD it/PPO onto/IN his/PP$ shoulder/NN after/IN some/DTI work/NN and/CC carried/VBD it/PPO outside/RB and/CC down/RP to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN ./.

He/PPS dumped/VBD it/PPO into/IN the/AT back/NN and/CC made/VBD sure/JJ it/PPS wouldn't/MD* roll/VB out/RP ,/, then/RB returned/VBD to/IN the/AT porch/NN and/CC closed/VBD the/AT front/JJ door/NN ,/, making/VBG sure/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ unlocked/VBN ./.

He/PPS drove/VBD carefully/RB in/IN the/AT direction/NN of/IN the/AT brief/JJ tour/NN they/PPSS had/HVD taken/VBN earlier/RBR ./.

It/PPS snowed/VBD continuously/RB ,/, but/CC quietly/RB ,/, evenly/RB ./.

When/WRB he/PPS reached/VBD the/AT dip/NN in/IN the/AT woods/NNS ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD that/CS already/RB the/AT earlier/JJR ruts/NNS were/BED barely/RB discernible/JJ ./.

The/AT Jeep/NN fought/VBD its/PP$ way/NN through/IN the/AT low/JJ spot/NN and/CC got/VBD onto/IN higher/JJR ground/NN ./.

He/PPS drove/VBD in/IN low/JJ gear/NN to/IN the/AT fork/NN in/IN the/AT road/NN and/CC swung/VBD as/QL close/RB as/CS possible/JJ to/IN the/AT entrance/NN to/IN the/AT abandoned/VBN mine/NN ./.

He/PPS parked/VBD facing/VBG it/PPO and/CC left/VBD the/AT headlights/NNS on/RP ,/, but/CC when/WRB he/PPS started/VBD into/IN the/AT tunnel/NN with/IN the/AT suitcase/NN ,/, he/PPS found/VBD the/AT illumination/NN extended/VBN no/AT farther/RBR than/CS half/ABN a/AT dozen/NN feet/NNS into/IN the/AT passage/NN ./.

He/PPS went/VBD back/RB and/CC got/VBD the/AT flashlight/NN ,/, returned/VBD to/IN the/AT tunnel/NN and/CC carried/VBD the/AT suitcase/NN to/IN the/AT edge/NN of/IN the/AT pit/NN he/PPS had/HVD found/VBN earlier/RBR ./.

He/PPS tossed/VBD the/AT bag/NN into/IN the/AT pit/NN and/CC watched/VBD dry/JJ dust/NN spray/VB up/RP around/IN it/PPO ./.

When/WRB the/AT dust/NN settled/VBD ,/, he/PPS went/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN and/CC carefully/RB worked/VBD Roberts'/NP$ body/NN onto/IN his/PP$ shoulder/NN ./.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* like/CS carrying/VBG the/AT suitcase/NN ./.

The/AT soft/JJ snow/NN was/BEDZ deceitful/JJ underfoot/RB ./.

Twice/RB he/PPS nearly/RB fell/VBD ./.

Inside/IN the/AT passage/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD to/TO work/VB his/PP$ way/NN over/IN the/AT fallen/VBN timber/NN and/CC nearly/RB collapsed/VBD under/IN his/PP$ clumsy/JJ burden/NN ./.

By/IN the/AT time/NN he/PPS reached/VBD the/AT edge/NN of/IN the/AT pit/NN he/PPS was/BEDZ panting/VBG and/CC his/PP$ shoulder/NN and/CC back/NN ached/VBD under/IN the/AT drag/NN of/IN the/AT dead/JJ weight/NN ./.

He/PPS stood/VBD looking/VBG down/RP for/IN a/AT few/AP seconds/NNS ,/, then/RB backed/VBD up/RP two/CD or/CC three/CD paces/NNS from/IN the/AT edge/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ too/QL much/AP weight/NN casually/RB to/TO toss/VB it/PPO away/RB ./.

He/PPS could/MD feel/VB himself/PPL falling/VBG in/RP with/IN it/PPO and/CC being/BEG unable/JJ to/TO get/VB out/RP ./.

It/PPS would/MD be/BE a/AT bad/JJ place/NN to/TO die/VB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT bad/JJ place/NN for/IN Roberts/NP to/TO wind/VB up/RP ,/, but/CC Roberts/NP had/HVD asked/VBN for/IN it/PPO ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ too/QL late/JJ to/TO worry/VB about/IN that/DT ./.

He/PPS knelt/VBD slowly/RB and/CC dumped/VBD the/AT corpse/NN onto/IN the/AT floor/NN of/IN the/AT tunnel/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT relief/NN to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN the/AT weight/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ shaking/VBG with/IN tension/NN and/CC it/PPS took/VBD him/PPO a/AT couple/NN of/IN minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB his/PP$ breath/NN and/CC settle/VB down/RP ./.

Then/RB he/PPS got/VBD on/IN his/PP$ knees/NNS and/CC rolled/VBD Roberts'/NP$ body/NN toward/IN the/AT edge/NN ./.

It/PPS hung/VBD momentarily/RB on/IN the/AT point/NN of/IN dropping/VBG off/RP ./.

He/PPS gave/VBD it/PPO a/AT strong/JJ push/NN ,/, heard/VBD it/PPS slide/VB ,/, then/RB tumble/VB dryly/RB into/IN the/AT hole/NN ./.

He/PPS got/VBD to/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS and/CC threw/VBD the/AT flashlight/NN beam/NN into/IN the/AT pit/NN ./.

The/AT body/NN lay/VBD in/IN an/AT awkward/JJ sprawl/NN twelve/CD or/CC fifteen/CD feet/NNS below/IN the/AT level/NN of/IN the/AT tunnel/NN floor/NN ./.

Deep/JJ enough/QLP ,/, he/PPS decided/VBD ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ little/AP chance/NN anyone/PN would/MD enter/VB this/DT shaft/NN during/IN the/AT winter/NN ./.

The/AT external/JJ signs/NNS of/IN his/PP$ approach/NN to/IN it/PPO would/MD be/BE covered/VBN by/IN the/AT snow/NN ,/, probably/RB by/IN the/AT next/AP day/NN ./.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* cold/JJ enough/QLP in/IN the/AT tunnel/NN to/TO preserve/VB the/AT body/NN intact/JJ ./.

By/IN spring/NN it/PPS would/MD be/BE a/AT skeleton/NN ./.

He/PPS made/VBD his/PP$ way/NN back/RB to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD started/VBN to/TO back/VB into/IN the/AT turn/NN when/WRB he/PPS remembered/VBD the/AT razor/NN in/IN his/PP$ pocket/NN ./.

He/PPS climbed/VBD down/RP ,/, went/VBD back/RB into/IN the/AT tunnel/NN and/CC tossed/VBD the/AT razor/NN into/IN the/AT pit/NN ./.

It/PPS landed/VBD on/IN Roberts'/NP$ sprawled/VBN right/JJ thigh/NN ,/, poised/VBN precariously/RB ,/, then/RB slid/VBD off/RP to/IN the/AT ground/NN ./.

He/PPS went/VBD back/RB once/RB more/RBR to/IN the/AT Jeep/NN and/CC started/VBD the/AT short/JJ drive/NN to/IN the/AT hotel/NN ./.

In/IN the/AT garage/NN he/PPS checked/VBD the/AT Jeep/NN for/IN signs/NNS of/IN the/AT use/NN he/PPS had/HVD made/VBN of/IN it/PPO ./.

There/EX were/BED stains/NNS here/RB and/CC there/RB and/CC he/PPS cleaned/VBD them/PPO off/RP ,/, using/VBG an/AT oiled/VBN rag/NN he/PPS found/VBD on/IN a/AT nail/NN ./.

He/PPS wiped/VBD the/AT steering/VBG wheel/NN and/CC all/ABN the/AT places/NNS he/PPS might/MD have/HV touched/VBN the/AT Jeep/NN ./.

He/PPS replaced/VBD the/AT flashlight/NN where/WRB it/PPS had/HVD been/BEN stowed/VBN ,/, got/VBD into/IN his/PP$ own/JJ car/NN and/CC backed/VBD it/PPO out/IN of/IN the/AT garage/NN ./.

There/EX were/BED tire/NN marks/NNS where/WRB it/PPS had/HVD been/BEN ,/, but/CC they/PPSS were/BED overlapped/VBN by/IN others/NNS and/CC on/IN the/AT dusty/JJ floor/NN would/MD not/* be/BE noticeable/JJ except/IN under/IN close/JJ scrutiny/NN ./.

Liz/NP Peabody/NP ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD ,/, might/MD spend/VB some/DTI time/NN grieving/VBG for/IN her/PP$ lost/VBN lover/NN ,/, but/CC he/PPS doubted/VBD that/CS she/PPS would/MD launch/VB an/AT investigation/NN ./.

He/PPS judged/VBD her/PPO to/TO be/BE a/AT woman/NN of/IN some/DTI pride/NN ,/, though/CS not/* much/AP sense/NN ./.

He/PPS put/VBD in/RP a/AT call/NN to/IN Cunningham/NP from/IN his/PP$ hotel/NN room/NN ./.

The/AT maid/NN answered/VBD and/CC he/PPS decided/VBD Nancy/NP must/MD be/BE at/IN work/NN ./.

Jeb/NP cautioned/VBD him/PPO not/* to/TO be/BE too/QL hopeful/JJ and/CC then/RB ,/, ignoring/VBG his/PP$ own/JJ advice/NN ,/, said/VBD excitedly/RB ,/, ``/`` But/CC it/PPS does/DOZ sound/VB good/JJ ./.

On/IN the/AT highway/NN he/PPS relaxed/VBD and/CC enjoyed/VBD the/AT drive/NN over/IN Lake/NN Pontchartrain/NP and/CC along/IN the/AT coast/NN ./.

Gulf/NN Springs/NNS was/BEDZ ten/CD miles/NNS inland/RB --/-- more/AP of/IN a/AT quaint/JJ old/JJ coast/NN town/NN than/CS those/DTS along/IN the/AT beach/NN made/VBN garish/JJ by/IN tourist/NN attractions/NNS ./.

The/AT courthouse/NN was/BEDZ a/AT white-stucco/NN building/NN minus/CC the/AT customary/JJ dome/NN ./.

He/PPS figured/VBD his/PP$ best/JJT bet/NN was/BEDZ a/AT call/NN on/IN the/AT sheriff/NN ./.

A/AT clerk/NN in/IN the/AT outer/JJ office/NN took/VBD him/PPO in/RP to/IN Sheriff/NN Carruthers/NP ,/, a/AT big/JJ ,/, paunchy/JJ man/NN with/IN thick/JJ ,/, white/JJ hair/NN and/CC a/AT voice/NN with/IN a/AT senatorial/JJ resonance/NN which/WDT suggested/VBD he/PPS should/MD be/BE running/VBG for/IN higher/JJR office/NN ./.

He/PPS glanced/VBD at/IN his/PP$ watch/NN ,/, saw/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ only/RB seven/CD ,/, and/CC decided/VBD to/TO indulge/VB his/PP$ weakness/NN now/RB ./.

``/`` Who's/WPS+BEZ there/RB ''/'' ?/. ?/.

He/PPS felt/VBD no/AT anger/NN towards/IN Kitti/NP ,/, no/AT sense/NN that/CS she/PPS had/HVD betrayed/VBN him/PPO ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ all/ABN he/PPS had/HVD ,/, everything/PN he/PPS had/HVD ,/, everything/PN he/PPS wanted/VBD ./.

He/PPS rose/VBD from/IN the/AT chair/NN ,/, took/VBD off/RP his/PP$ coat/NN ./.

The/AT bed/NN still/RB showed/VBD signs/NNS of/IN where/WRB Kitti/NP had/HVD lain/VBN ./.

Gilborn/NP stood/VBD there/RB for/IN a/AT long/JJ time/NN ./.

Kitti/NP would/MD lie/VB in/IN it/PPS no/RB more/RBR ./.

Gilborn/NP wondered/VBD whether/CS Kitti/NP had/HVD lain/VBN in/IN that/DT same/AP bed/NN with/IN Who/WPS ?/. ?/.

For/IN thirty/CD minutes/NNS ,/, Stanley/NP Gilborn/NP stood/VBD there/RB ./.

At/IN the/AT end/NN of/IN the/AT half-hour/NN ,/, racking/VBG his/PP$ brains/NNS ,/, thinking/VBG over/RP and/CC over/RP again/RB of/IN Kitti/NP ,/, her/PP$ friends/NNS ,/, her/PP$ past/NN ,/, he/PPS left/VBD the/AT bedroom/NN ./.

Who/WPS ?/. ?/.

He/PPS could/MD think/VB of/IN no/AT answer/NN ./.

Gilborn/NP put/VBD on/RP his/PP$ coat/NN again/RB ./.

Before/IN leaving/VBG ,/, he/PPS took/VBD one/CD last/AP ,/, lingering/VBG look/NN at/IN the/AT apartment/NN ./.

He/PPS knew/VBD he/PPS would/MD never/RB see/VB it/PPO again/RB ./.

In/IN the/AT street/NN ,/, walking/VBG as/QL quickly/RB as/CS he/PPS could/MD ,/, Stanley/NP Gilborn/NP was/BEDZ a/AT lone/JJ figure/NN ./.

On/IN Blanche/NP Jacobs/NP ,/, Kitti/NP Gilborn's/NP$ death/NN had/HVD a/AT quite/QL different/JJ effect/NN ./.

For/IN Blanche/NP ,/, Kitti's/NP$ death/NN was/BEDZ a/AT source/NN of/IN guilty/JJ ,/, but/CC nonetheless/RB soaring/VBG ,/, happy/JJ hope/NN ./.

In/IN Blanche's/NP$ defense/NN ,/, it/PPS must/MD be/BE said/VBN she/PPS was/BEDZ unaware/JJ of/IN the/AT newborn/JJ hope/NN ./.

If/CS anyone/PN had/HVD asked/VBN her/PPO ,/, she/PPS would/MD have/HV described/VBN herself/PPL only/RB as/RB nervous/JJ and/CC worried/VBN ./.

The/AT figures/NNS on/IN the/AT worksheet/NN paper/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN her/PPO were/BED jumping/VBG and/CC waving/VBG around/RB so/QL badly/RB it/PPS was/BEDZ all/ABN she/PPS could/MD do/DO to/TO make/VB them/PPO out/RP clearly/RB enough/QLP to/TO copy/VB them/PPO with/IN the/AT typewriter/NN ./.

She/PPS wondered/VBD whether/CS Stanley/NP would/MD call/VB ./.

She/PPS wanted/VBD to/TO be/BE with/IN him/PPO ,/, to/TO give/VB him/PPO the/AT comfort/NN and/CC companionship/NN she/PPS knew/VBD he/PPS needed/VBD ./.

She/PPS had/HVD skipped/VBN her/PP$ lunch/NN hour/NN in/IN the/AT fear/NN that/CS he/PPS might/MD call/VB while/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ out/RP ./.

He/PPS hadn't/HVD* ./.

And/CC now/RB she/PPS was/BEDZ feeling/VBG sick/JJ ,/, both/ABX from/IN concern/NN about/IN Stanley/NP and/CC hunger/NN ./.

Why/WRB hadn't/HVD* he/PPS called/VBN ?/. ?/.

Men/NNS ,/, she/PPS reflected/VBD ,/, even/RB men/NNS like/IN Stanley/NP ,/, are/BER unpredictable/JJ ./.

She/PPS tried/VBD to/TO think/VB of/IN his/PP$ unpredictable/JJ actions/NNS in/IN the/AT eleven/CD years/NNS she/PPS had/HVD known/VBN him/PPO and/CC discovered/VBD they/PPSS weren't/BED* so/QL many/AP after/IN all/ABN ./.

Stanley/NP really/RB was/BEDZ quite/QL predictable/JJ ./.

That/DT was/BEDZ one/CD of/IN the/AT things/NNS she/PPS liked/VBD about/IN Stanley/NP ./.

He/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* like/IN so/QL many/AP other/AP men/NNS ./.

The/AT dentist/NN last/AP night/NN ,/, for/IN instance/NN ./.

Dinner/NN and/CC the/AT movies/NNS had/HVD been/BEN fine/JJ ./.

He/PPS had/HVD taken/VBN her/PPO upstairs/RB to/TO say/VB good/JJ night/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD invited/VBN him/PPO in/RP for/IN coffee/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN the/AT kitchen/NN ,/, as/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ watching/VBG the/AT kettle/NN ,/, waiting/VBG for/IN the/AT water/NN to/TO boil/VB ,/, that/CS he/PPS had/HVD grabbed/VBN for/IN her/PPO ./.

Without/IN warning/VBG ,/, without/IN giving/VBG her/PPO a/AT chance/NN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN it/PPO ./.

From/IN behind/RB ,/, he/PPS had/HVD put/VBN his/PP$ arms/NNS on/IN her/PP$ shoulders/NNS ,/, turned/VBN her/PPO around/RB ,/, and/CC pressed/VBN her/PPO to/IN him/PPO ,/, so/QL close/RB she/PPS couldn't/MD* breathe/VB ./.

Later/RBR ,/, she/PPS apologized/VBD for/IN the/AT long/JJ scratch/NN across/IN his/PP$ face/NN ,/, tried/VBD to/TO explain/VB she/PPS couldn't/MD* help/VB herself/PPL ,/, that/CS the/AT panic/NN arose/VBD in/IN her/PPO unwanted/JJ ./.

But/CC he/PPS hadn't/HVD* understood/VBN ./.

When/WRB he/PPS left/VBD ,/, she/PPS knew/VBD she/PPS would/MD never/RB see/VB him/PPO again/RB ./.

Stanley/NP wasn't/BEDZ* like/IN that/DT ./.

She/PPS could/MD always/RB predict/VB what/WDT Stanley/NP was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO do/DO ,/, ever/RB since/CS she/PPS first/RB met/VBD him/PPO ./.

Except/IN for/IN that/DT one/CD morning/NN ./.

The/AT morning/NN he/PPS walked/VBD in/RP to/TO announce/VB to/IN her/PPO ,/, blushing/VBG ,/, that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ married/VBN ./.

She/PPS thought/VBD she/PPS was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO die/VB ./.

She/PPS had/HVD assumed/VBN before/IN then/RN that/CS one/CD day/NN he/PPS would/MD ask/VB her/PPO to/TO marry/VB him/PPO ./.

Blanche/NP couldn't/MD* remember/VB when/WRB she/PPS had/HVD first/RB arrived/VBN at/IN this/DT conclusion/NN ./.

She/PPS thought/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ sometime/RB during/IN the/AT second/OD week/NN she/PPS worked/VBD for/IN Stanley/NP ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ nothing/PN that/WPO he/PPS said/VBD or/CC did/DOD ,/, but/CC it/PPS seemed/VBD so/QL natural/JJ to/IN her/PPO that/CS she/PPS should/MD be/BE working/VBG for/IN him/PPO ,/, looking/VBG forward/RB to/IN his/PP$ eventual/JJ proposal/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ thirty-one/CD years/NNS old/JJ then/RB ./.

Her/PP$ mother/NN was/BEDZ already/RB considerably/RB concerned/VBN over/IN her/PP$ daughter's/NN$ future/NN ./.

But/CC Blanche/NP had/HVD been/BEN able/JJ to/TO maintain/VB a/AT serene/JJ and/CC assured/VBN composure/NN in/IN the/AT face/NN of/IN her/PPO widowed/VBN mother's/NN$ continued/VBN carping/NN ,/, had/HVD been/BEN able/JJ to/TO resist/VB her/PPO urgings/NNS to/TO date/NN anyone/PN who/WPS offered/VBD the/AT slightest/JJT possibility/NN of/IN matrimony/NN ./.

For/IN Blanche/NP ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ only/RB a/AT matter/NN of/IN time/NN before/CS Stanley/NP would/MD propose/VB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ to/TO be/BE expected/VBN that/CS Stanley/NP would/MD be/BE shy/JJ ,/, slow/JJ in/IN taking/VBG such/ABL a/AT momentous/JJ step/NN ./.

Stanley/NP went/VBD along/RB in/IN life/NN ,/, she/PPS knew/VBD ,/, convinced/VBN that/CS he/PPS deserved/VBD the/AT love/NN and/CC faith/NN of/IN no/AT woman/NN ./.

As/IN a/AT result/NN ,/, he/PPS never/RB looked/VBD for/IN it/PPO ./.

But/CC one/CD day/NN ,/, she/PPS expected/VBD ,/, he/PPS would/MD somehow/RB discover/VB ,/, without/IN her/PP$ having/HVG to/TO tell/VB him/PPO ,/, that/CS there/EX was/BEDZ such/ABL a/AT woman/NN in/IN the/AT world/NN ;/. ;/.

a/AT woman/NN who/WPS was/BEDZ willing/JJ to/TO give/VB him/PPO love/NN ,/, faith/NN ,/, and/CC anything/PN else/RB a/AT woman/NN could/MD give/VB a/AT husband/NN ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT woman/NN who/WPS ,/, unasked/JJ ,/, had/HVD already/RB given/VBN him/PPO love/NN ./.

Unquestionably/RB ,/, Blanche/NP loved/VBD Stanley/NP ./.

And/CC then/RB ,/, unexpectedly/RB ,/, Stanley/NP made/VBD his/PP$ announcement/NN ./.

On/IN that/DT first/OD day/NN ,/, Blanche/NP literally/RB thought/VBD she/PPS was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO die/VB ,/, or/CC ,/, at/IN the/AT very/QL least/AP ,/, go/VB out/RP of/IN her/PP$ mind/NN ./.

It/PPS might/MD have/HV been/BEN easier/JJR for/IN her/PPO if/CS Kitti/NP Walker/NP hadn't/HVD* been/BEN everything/PN that/CS Blanche/NP was/BEDZ not/* ./.

Kitti/NP was/BEDZ thirty/CD years/NNS younger/JJR than/CS Stanley/NP ,/, taller/JJR than/CS Stanley/NP ,/, prettier/JJR than/CS Stanley/NP had/HVD any/DTI right/NN to/TO hope/VB for/IN ,/, much/QL less/RBR expect/VB ./.

Kitti/NP could/MD have/HV married/VBN a/AT score/NN of/IN men/NNS ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT reason/NN for/IN her/PPO to/TO marry/VB someone/PN like/IN Stanley/NP Gilborn/NP ,/, there/EX was/BEDZ no/AT need/NN for/IN her/PPO to/TO marry/VB Stanley/NP ./.

Kitti/NP had/HVD come/VBN into/IN the/AT office/NN ,/, on/IN somebody's/PN$ recommendation/NN ,/, because/CS she/PPS needed/VBD help/NN in/IN preparing/VBG her/PP$ income/NN tax/NN return/NN ./.

Stanley/NP had/HVD filled/VBN out/RP the/AT return/NN and/CC because/CS ,/, when/WRB he/PPS was/BEDZ finished/VBN ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ close/JJ to/IN the/AT lunch/NN hour/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD politely/RB asked/VBN Kitti/NP to/TO join/VB him/PPO ,/, never/RB expecting/VBG her/PPO to/TO accept/VB ./.

Blanche/NP knew/VBD all/ABN this/DT because/CS the/AT door/NN to/IN Stanley's/NP$ office/NN was/BEDZ open/JJ and/CC ,/, without/IN straining/VBG too/QL hard/RB ,/, she/PPS could/MD hear/VB everything/PN that/WPS was/BEDZ said/VBN ./.

Stanley/NP had/HVD gone/VBN out/RP ,/, saying/VBG he/PPS would/MD be/BE back/RB in/IN an/AT hour/NN ./.

He/PPS hadn't/HVD* come/VBN back/RB for/IN over/IN two/CD ./.

After/IN that/DT day/NN ,/, Blanche/NP still/RB didn't/DOD* know/VB exactly/RB what/WDT had/HVD happened/VBN ./.

There/EX were/BED mornings/NNS when/WRB Stanley/NP came/VBD in/RP late/RB ,/, afternoons/NNS when/WRB he/PPS left/VBD early/RB ,/, days/NNS when/WRB he/PPS didn't/DOD* come/VB in/IN at/IN all/ABN ./.

Blanche/NP knew/VBD something/PN must/MD be/BE causing/VBG Stanley's/NP$ new/JJ ,/, strange/JJ behavior/NN but/CC she/PPS never/RB once/RB connected/VBD it/PPO with/IN Kitti/NP Walker/NP ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ too/QL unprecedented/JJ ./.

Then/RB ,/, six/CD weeks/NNS after/IN the/AT day/NN Kitti/NP first/RB came/VBD into/IN the/AT office/NN ,/, Stanley/NP announced/VBD he/PPS and/CC Kitti/NP were/BED married/VBN ./.

Somehow/RB ,/, Blanche/NP managed/VBD to/TO cover/VB the/AT stunned/VBN surprise/NN and/CC offer/VB her/PP$ congratulations/NNS ./.

That/DT night/NN the/AT two/CD of/IN them/PPO left/VBD for/IN a/AT week's/NN$ honeymoon/NN in/IN Acapulco/NP ./.

While/CS they/PPSS were/BED away/RB Blanche/NP came/VBD into/IN the/AT office/NN every/AT morning/NN ,/, running/VBG things/NNS as/CS she/PPS had/HVD always/RB run/VBN them/PPO for/IN Stanley/NP ,/, going/VBG through/IN the/AT week/NN in/IN a/AT dazed/VBN stupor/NN ,/, getting/VBG things/NNS done/VBN automatically/RB ,/, out/IN of/IN habit/NN ./.

For/IN exactly/RB one/CD week/NN ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ able/JJ to/TO continue/VB in/IN this/DT manner/NN ./.

On/IN the/AT morning/NN of/IN Stanley's/NP$ return/NN ,/, however/WRB ,/, her/PP$ strength/NN left/VBD her/PPO ./.

Two/CD hours/NNS of/IN watching/VBG his/PP$ serenely/RB happy/JJ face/NN ,/, listening/VBG to/IN his/PP$ soft/JJ humming/NN as/CS he/PPS bent/VBD over/IN his/PP$ penciled/VBN figures/NNS ,/, and/CC Blanche/NP had/HVD to/TO leave/VB ./.

She/PPS stayed/VBD away/RB for/IN ten/CD days/NNS ./.

Those/DTS ten/CD days/NNS were/BED like/IN no/AT others/NNS that/CS Blanche/NP had/HVD known/VBN ./.

Mostly/RB ,/, she/PPS stayed/VBD in/IN bed/NN ./.

She/PPS didn't/DOD* tell/VB anyone/PN ,/, even/RB her/PP$ mother/NN ,/, what/WDT was/BEDZ wrong/JJ ./.

She/PPS refused/VBD to/TO have/HV a/AT doctor/NN ,/, insisting/VBG there/EX was/BEDZ nothing/PN a/AT doctor/NN could/MD do/DO for/IN her/PPO ./.

``/`` Right/RB ''/'' ,/, said/VBD the/AT fingerprint/NN man/NN ./.

``/`` Also/RB ,/, if/CS you're/PPSS+BER going/VBG to/TO believe/VB those/DTS prints/NNS ,/, you'll/PPSS+MD have/HV to/TO look/VB for/IN a/AT killer/NN who's/WPS+BEZ a/AT top-grade/NN piano/NN player/NN ''/'' ./.

He/PPS demonstrated/VBD by/IN playing/VBG an/AT imaginary/JJ piano/NN ,/, doing/VBG a/AT staccato/NN passage/NN with/IN a/AT broadly/RB exaggerated/VBN attack/NN ./.

To/TO make/VB it/PPO clearer/JJR he/PPS shifted/VBD to/IN acting/VBG out/RP ,/, but/CC with/IN no/AT change/NN of/IN manner/NN ,/, the/AT killing/NN of/IN Rose/NP Mallory/NP ./.

His/PP$ hands/NNS snatched/VBD at/IN an/AT imaginary/JJ bucket/NN ,/, swooping/VBG down/RP hard/RB to/TO grab/VB it/PPO and/CC coming/VBG away/RB with/IN equal/JJ snap/NN like/IN a/AT ball/NN that's/WPS+HVZ been/BEN bounced/VBN hard/RB ./.

In/IN the/AT same/AP way/NN he/PPS pantomimed/VBD grasping/VBG a/AT mantel/NN and/CC bouncing/VBG cleanly/RB off/IN that/DT ,/, pressing/VBG his/PP$ hands/NNS against/IN the/AT floor/NN and/CC bouncing/VBG cleanly/RB off/IN that/DT ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ moving/VBG like/IN a/AT ballet/NN dancer/NN ,/, playing/VBG for/IN laughs/NNS ./.

If/CS Rose/NP Mallory's/NP$ killer/NN acted/VBD this/DT way/NN ,/, catching/VBG up/RP with/IN him/PPO was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO be/BE a/AT cinch/NN ./.

He/PPS ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, must/MD have/HV been/BEN equally/RB unprepared/JJ for/IN what/WDT confronted/VBD him/PPO ,/, but/CC ,/, nonetheless/RB ,/, I/PPSS did/DOD find/VB his/PP$ reaction/NN startling/JJ ./.

If/CS Felix/NP was/BEDZ still/RB wearing/VBG the/AT hat/NN and/CC carrying/VBG the/AT horn/NN because/CS he'd/PPS+HVD forgotten/VBN about/IN them/PPO ,/, he/PPS now/RB remembered/VBD ./.

He/PPS came/VBD bounding/VBG up/IN the/AT stairs/NNS and/CC joined/VBD the/AT dance/NN ./.

He/PPS adjusted/VBD the/AT hat/NN ,/, lifted/VBD the/AT horn/NN to/IN his/PP$ lips/NNS as/CS though/CS it/PPS were/BED a/AT flute/NN ,/, and/CC fell/VBD in/RP alongside/IN our/PP$ fingerprint/NN expert/NN to/TO cavort/VB with/IN him/PPO ./.

Our/PP$ man/NN stopped/VBD dead/JJ and/CC glowered/VBD at/IN Felix/NP ./.

Felix/NP threw/VBD his/PP$ head/NN back/RB and/CC laughed/VBD a/AT laugh/NN that/WPS shook/VBD the/AT timbers/NNS of/IN even/RB that/DT solidly/RB built/VBN old/JJ house/NN ./.

This/DT was/BEDZ a/AT bull/NN of/IN a/AT man/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ big-chested/JJ ,/, big-shouldered/JJ and/CC heavy-armed/JJ ./.

His/PP$ face/NN was/BEDZ ruddy/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ and/CC unlined/JJ ,/, and/CC when/WRB he/PPS laughed/VBD he/PPS showed/VBD his/PP$ teeth/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/BED big/JJ and/CC white/JJ and/CC strong/JJ and/CC unquestionably/RB home-grown/JJ ./.

I/PPSS don't/DO* remember/VB ever/RB seeing/VBG teeth/NNS that/WPS were/BED quite/QL so/QL white/JJ and/CC at/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN quite/QL so/QL emphatically/RB not/* dentures/NNS ./.

His/PP$ hair/NN had/HVD receded/VBN most/AP of/IN the/AT way/NN to/IN the/AT back/NN of/IN his/PP$ neck/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD only/RB a/AT fringe/NN of/IN hair/NN and/CC he/PPS wore/VBD it/PPO cropped/VBN short/JJ ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ almost/RB as/QL white/JJ as/CS his/PP$ teeth/NNS ./.

For/IN a/AT man/NN of/IN his/PP$ mass/NN he/PPS was/BEDZ curiously/RB short/JJ ./.

He/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* a/AT dwarf/NN but/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT bit/NN of/IN a/AT comic/JJ figure/NN ./.

A/AT man/NN with/IN so/QL big/JJ and/CC so/QL staggeringly/RB developed/VBN a/AT torso/NN and/CC such/JJ long/JJ and/CC powerful/JJ arms/NNS is/BEZ expected/VBN to/TO stand/VB taller/JJR than/CS five/CD feet/NNS five/CD ./.

For/IN Felix/NP it/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT bit/NN of/IN a/AT stretch/NN to/TO make/VB even/RB that/DT measurement/NN ./.

The/AT man/NN was/BEDZ just/RB this/DT side/NN of/IN being/BEG a/AT freak/NN ./.

We/PPSS waited/VBD till/CS he/PPS had/HVD finished/VBN laughing/VBG ,/, and/CC that/DT gave/VBD us/PPO a/AT few/AP moments/NNS for/IN taking/VBG stock/NN of/IN him/PPO ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ dressed/VBN in/IN a/AT manner/NN Esquire/NP might/MD suggest/VB for/IN the/AT outdoor/JJ man's/NN$ country/NN weekend/NN ./.

Dark/JJ gray/JJ sports/NNS jacket/NN ,/, lighter/JJR gray/JJ slacks/NNS ,/, pink/JJ flannel/NN shirt/NN ,/, black/JJ silk/NN necktie/NN ./.

``/`` Felix/NP Grubb/NP ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` No/RB ./.

Edmund/NP ,/, but/CC not/* for/IN years/NNS ./.

For/IN years/NNS it's/PPS+HVZ been/BEN just/RB Felix/NP ./.

First/OD thing/NN I/PPSS did/DOD after/IN my/PP$ twenty-first/OD birthday/NN was/BEDZ go/VB into/IN court/NN and/CC have/HV it/PPO officially/RB changed/VBN ,/, and/CC this/DT is/BEZ something/PN I/PPSS don't/DO* tell/VB everybody/PN ./.

That/DT was/BEDZ almost/RB forty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ''/'' ./.

Having/HVG volunteered/VBN that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT man/NN of/IN about/RB sixty/CD ,/, he/PPS bounded/VBD up/IN the/AT stairs/NNS and/CC with/IN each/DT leap/NN rendered/VBD the/AT number/NN less/QL credible/JJ ./.

This/DT was/BEDZ a/AT broth/NN of/IN a/AT boy/NN ,/, our/PP$ Felix/NP ,/, and/CC nothing/PN was/BEDZ more/QL obvious/JJ than/CS the/AT joy/NN he/PPS took/VBD in/IN demonstrating/VBG how/WRB agile/JJ he/PPS was/BEDZ and/CC how/WRB full/JJ of/IN juice/NN and/CC spirit/NN ./.

We/PPSS followed/VBD him/PPO up/IN the/AT stairs/NNS ./.

The/AT cops/NNS would/MD gather/VB up/RP Connor/NP and/CC the/AT foursome/NN on/IN the/AT third/OD floor/NN and/CC bring/VB us/PPO those/DTS of/IN them/PPO who/WPS would/MD voluntarily/RB submit/VB to/IN fingerprinting/VBG ./.

You/PPSS may/MD think/VB we/PPSS didn't/DOD* need/VB Nancy/NP and/CC Jean/NP ,/, but/CC you/PPSS always/RB get/VB what/WDT you/PPSS can/MD when/WRB you/PPSS can/MD ,/, and/CC we/PPSS had/HVD no/AT guarantee/NN that/CS a/AT fingerprint/NN record/NN on/IN them/PPO couldn't/MD* be/BE useful/JJ before/CS we/PPSS were/BED through/RP with/IN this/DT case/NN ./.

If/CS you/PPSS can/MD possibly/RB avoid/VB it/PPO ,/, you/PPSS don't/DO* hand/VB out/RP any/DTI extra/JJ chances/NNS ./.

Felix/NP took/VBD us/PPO into/IN his/PP$ studio/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ that/DT oddly/RB shaped/VBN space/NN at/IN the/AT very/JJ top/NN of/IN the/AT house/NN ,/, where/WRB ceiling/NN heights/NNS had/HVD to/TO accommodate/VB themselves/PPLS to/IN the/AT varying/VBG angles/NNS of/IN roof/NN slope/NN ./.

At/IN each/DT angle/NN of/IN its/PP$ pitch/NN a/AT big/JJ skylight/NN had/HVD been/BEN fitted/VBN into/IN the/AT roof/NN and/CC all/ABN these/DTS skylights/NNS were/BED fitted/VBN with/IN systems/NNS of/IN multiple/JJ screens/NNS and/CC shades/NNS ./.

When/WRB Felix/NP first/RB opened/VBD the/AT door/NN on/IN it/PPO ,/, all/ABN these/DTS shades/NNS were/BED tightly/RB drawn/VBN and/CC the/AT whole/JJ studio/NN was/BEDZ as/QL dark/JJ as/CS night/NN ./.

He/PPS quickly/RB fixed/VBD that/DT ,/, rolling/VBG back/RB the/AT shades/NNS on/IN some/DTI of/IN the/AT skylights/NNS and/CC adjusting/VBG screens/NNS on/IN the/AT others/NNS ./.

He/PPS flew/VBD about/IN the/AT place/NN making/VBG these/DTS adjustments/NNS and/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ obvious/JJ that/CS what/WDT he/PPS was/BEDZ doing/VBG was/BEDZ the/AT fruit/NN of/IN long/JJ experience/NN ./.

None/PN of/IN his/PP$ movements/NNS was/BEDZ tentative/JJ ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT process/NN of/IN trial/NN and/CC error/NN ./.

Starting/VBG with/IN the/AT room/NN completely/RB blacked/VBN out/RP ,/, as/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ when/WRB we/PPSS came/VBD in/RP ,/, he/PPS unerringly/RB fixed/VBD things/NNS so/CS that/CS the/AT whole/JJ place/NN was/BEDZ bathed/VBN in/IN the/AT maximum/JJ of/IN light/NN without/IN at/IN any/DTI point/NN admitting/VBG even/RB so/QL much/AP as/CS a/AT crack/NN of/IN glare/NN ./.

Expecting/VBG something/PN more-than-average/JJ wacky/JJ ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ surprised/VBN by/IN what/WDT we/PPSS found/VBD ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT display/NN of/IN either/CC works/NNS in/IN progress/NN or/CC of/IN finished/VBN work/NN ./.

They/PPSS were/BED all/ABN completely/RB shrouded/VBN ./.

The/AT equipment/NN was/BEDZ solid/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ and/CC in/IN good/JJ condition/NN ./.

Everything/PN was/BEDZ orderly/JJ and/CC it/PPS seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE arranged/VBN for/IN the/AT workman's/NN$ comfort/NN ,/, convenience/NN and/CC efficiency/NN ./.

There/EX were/BED tools/NNS about/RB but/CC they/PPSS were/BED neatly/RB kept/VBN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT confusion/NN and/CC no/AT litter/NN ./.

Supplies/NNS of/IN sheet/NN metal/NN were/BED neatly/RB stacked/VBN in/IN bins/NNS ./.

Andy/NP did/DOD not/* see/VB the/AT newspapers/NNS the/AT next/AP day/NN ./.

Presumably/RB the/AT same/AP sun/NN was/BEDZ shining/VBG upon/IN little/JJ Drew/NP also/RB ,/, and/CC those/DTS who/WPS had/HVD kidnapped/VBN him/PPO ./.

For/IN another/DT second/OD or/CC two/CD he/PPS gave/VBD in/RP to/IN the/AT annoyance/NN that/WPS was/BEDZ directed/VBN at/IN himself/PPL ;/. ;/.

then/RB his/PP$ mind/NN moved/VBD on/RP to/TO be/BE confronted/VBN by/IN something/PN far/QL more/QL serious/JJ ,/, and/CC as/CS the/AT thought/NN expanded/VBD ,/, the/AT implications/NNS jarred/VBD him/PPO ./.

It/PPS no/AT longer/JJR mattered/VBD that/CS Burton/NP had/HVD outsmarted/VBN him/PPO ./.

The/AT important/JJ thing/NN was/BEDZ that/CS Burton/NP had/HVD gone/VBN somewhere/NN to/TO meet/VB a/AT blackmailer/NN with/IN a/AT gun/NN in/IN his/PP$ pocket/NN ./.

Even/RB before/CS his/PP$ mind/NN had/HVD rounded/VBN out/RP the/AT idea/NN ,/, he/PPS thrust/VBD one/CD hand/NN into/IN his/PP$ trousers/NNS pocket/NN and/CC pulled/VBD out/RP the/AT six/CD slugs/NNS he/PPS had/HVD taken/VBN from/IN the/AT revolver/NN ./.

He/PPS considered/VBD them/PPO with/IN brooding/VBG eyes/NNS ,/, brows/NNS bunched/VBN as/CS his/PP$ brain/NN grappled/VBD with/IN the/AT problem/NN and/CC tried/VBD to/TO find/VB some/DTI solution/NN ./.

He/PPS said/VBD :/: ``/`` The/AT crazy/JJ fool/NN ''/'' ,/, half/QL aloud/RB ./.

He/PPS put/VBD the/AT shells/NNS on/IN the/AT table/NN ,/, as/CS though/CS he/PPS could/MD no/AT longer/JJR bear/VB to/TO hold/VB them/PPO ./.

He/PPS thought/VBD :/: Where/WRB the/AT hell/NN could/MD he/PPS have/HV gone/VBN ?/. ?/.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT answer/NN to/IN this/DT and/CC he/PPS began/VBD to/TO pace/VB back/RB and/CC forth/RB across/IN the/AT room/NN ,/, his/PP$ imagination/NN out/IN of/IN control/NN ./.

He/PPS tried/VBD to/TO tell/VB himself/PPL that/CS maybe/RB Burton/NP had/HVD sobered/VBN up/RP enough/AP to/TO get/VB some/DTI sense/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, as/CS he/PPS turned/VBD toward/IN the/AT telephone/NN ,/, it/PPS rang/VBD shrilly/RB to/TO shatter/VB the/AT stillness/NN in/IN the/AT room/NN and/CC he/PPS reached/VBD for/IN it/PPO eagerly/RB ./.

``/`` Yeah/RB ''/'' ./.

``/`` Tony/NP Calenda/NP ''/'' ./.

Casey/NP heard/VBD the/AT voice/NN distinctly/RB and/CC he/PPS knew/VBD who/WPS it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, but/CC it/PPS took/VBD him/PPO a/AT while/NN to/TO make/VB the/AT mental/JJ readjustment/NN and/CC control/NN the/AT disturbance/NN inside/IN his/PP$ head/NN ./.

``/`` I/PPSS wouldn't/MD* even/VB want/VB it/PPO to/TO get/VB around/RB ''/'' ./.

Under/IN normal/JJ circumstances/NNS Casey/NP was/BEDZ a/AT little/AP fussy/JJ when/WRB people/NNS told/VBD him/PPO what/WDT to/TO do/DO with/IN pictures/NNS he/PPS had/HVD taken/VBN ./.

Even/QL so/RB ,/, he/PPS generally/RB listened/VBD and/CC was/BEDZ usually/RB reasonable/JJ to/IN those/DTS who/WPS voiced/VBD their/PP$ objections/NNS properly/RB ./.

Right/QL now/RB ,/, however/WRB ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ still/RB too/QL worried/VBN about/IN Jerry/NP Burton/NP ,/, and/CC the/AT gun/NN that/WPS had/HVD no/AT bullets/NNS ,/, and/CC the/AT story/NN Burton/NP had/HVD told/VBN him/PPO ,/, to/TO care/VB too/QL much/AP about/IN Tony/NP Calenda/NP ./.

His/PP$ nerves/NNS were/BED getting/VBG a/AT little/AP ragged/JJ and/CC his/PP$ impatience/NN put/VBD an/AT edge/NN in/IN his/PP$ voice/NN ./.

``/`` Look/VB ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ./.

``/`` I/PPSS was/BEDZ hired/VBN to/TO take/VB a/AT picture/NN ./.

``/`` Maybe/RB you'd/PPSS+HVD better/RBR tell/VB the/AT guy/NN who/WPS hired/VBD you/PPO what/WDT I/PPSS said/VBD ''/'' ./.

``/`` Just/RB be/BE sure/JJ to/TO send/VB your/PP$ two/CD best/JJT boys/NNS ,/, Tony/NP ''/'' ./.

He/PPS hung/VBD up/RP with/IN a/AT bang/NN ,/, annoyed/VBN at/IN himself/PPL for/CS running/VBG off/RP at/IN the/AT mouth/NN like/CS that/DT but/CC still/RB terribly/RB concerned/VBN with/IN the/AT situation/NN he/PPS had/HVD helped/VBN to/TO create/VB ./.

As/QL soon/RB as/CS he/PPS could/MD think/VB logically/RB again/RB he/PPS reached/VBD for/IN the/AT telephone/NN directory/NN and/CC found/VBD Jerry/NP Burton's/NP$ home/NR number/NN ./.

He/PPS dialed/VBD it/PPO and/CC listened/VBD to/IN it/PPO ring/VB ten/CD times/NNS before/CS he/PPS hung/VBD up/RP ./.

He/PPS called/VBD the/AT bar/NN and/CC grill/NN where/WRB he/PPS had/HVD picked/VBN Burton/NP up/RP that/DT afternoon/NN ./.

When/WRB he/PPS was/BEDZ told/VBN that/CS no/AT one/PN had/HVD seen/VBN Burton/NP since/IN then/RB ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD of/IN three/CD other/AP places/NNS that/WPS were/BED possibilities/NNS ./.

He/PPS kept/VBD telling/VBG himself/PPL this/DT as/CS he/PPS went/VBD out/RP to/IN the/AT kitchen/NN to/TO make/VB a/AT drink/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD just/RB finished/VBN unlacing/VBG the/AT right/JJ one/CD when/WRB the/AT telephone/NN rang/VBD again/RB ./.

``/`` Casey/NP ?/. ?/.

A/AT few/AP passed/VBN along/RB a/AT tip/NN for/IN the/AT simple/JJ reason/NN that/CS they/PPSS liked/VBD him/PPO and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO give/VB him/PPO a/AT break/NN ./.

Only/RB an/AT occasional/JJ tip/NN turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/BE a/AT phony/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, like/CS the/AT police/NNS ,/, Casey/NP had/HVD made/VBN a/AT point/NN of/IN running/VBG down/RP all/QL such/JJ suggestions/NNS and/CC he/PPS did/DOD not/* hesitate/VB this/DT time/NN ./.

The/AT police/NN car/NN had/HVD pulled/VBN up/RP behind/IN a/AT small/JJ sedan/NN ,/, its/PP$ headlights/NNS still/RB on/RP ./.

Slowly/RB he/PPS pulled/VBD out/RP the/AT hand/NN throttle/NN until/CS the/AT boat/NN was/BEDZ moving/VBG at/IN little/AP more/RBR than/IN a/AT crawl/NN ,/, and/CC watched/VBD Elaine/NP rapidly/RB spin/VB from/IN one/CD station/NN to/IN another/DT ,/, tune/VB in/IN the/AT null/NN ,/, then/RB draw/VB in/RP a/AT line/NN on/IN the/AT chart/NN ./.

``/`` We're/PPSS+BER out/RP just/RB a/AT little/AP too/QL far/RB ./.

The/AT rock/NN and/CC roll/NN music/NN coming/VBG from/IN the/AT radio/NN station/NN suddenly/RB faded/VBD as/CS the/AT boat/NN coasted/VBD into/IN the/AT null/NN on/IN the/AT Aj/NP ./.

``/`` Reverse/VB ''/'' ,/, Elaine/NP said/VBD ,/, then/RB peered/VBD through/IN the/AT loop/NN of/IN the/AT RDF/NN and/CC waved/VBD to/IN Poet/NN ./.

Nick/NP watched/VBD her/PPO somewhat/QL enviously/RB as/CS she/PPS efficiently/RB cut/VBD the/AT engines/NNS ,/, and/CC started/VBD the/AT auxiliary/JJ motor/NN ./.

Poet/NN came/VBD up/RP from/IN below/RB ,/, wearing/VBG new/JJ bathing/VBG trunks/NNS ./.

The/AT price/NN tag/NN hung/VBD from/IN the/AT belt/NN and/CC he/PPS pulled/VBD it/PPO off/RP as/CS he/PPS entered/VBD the/AT chartroom/NN and/CC looked/VBD at/IN it/PPO curiously/RB ./.

Nick/NP wondered/VBD if/CS Elaine/NP had/HVD bought/VBN them/PPO ,/, but/CC he/PPS said/VBD nothing/PN ./.

Nobody/PN ,/, he/PPS suddenly/RB realized/VBD ,/, was/BEDZ saying/VBG anything/PN ./.

But/CC instead/RB of/IN chatter/NN there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT null/NN ,/, like/CS on/IN the/AT radio/NN direction/NN finder/NN ./.

Once/RB ,/, in/IN New/JJ York/NP ,/, he/PPS had/HVD gone/VBN flying/VBG with/IN some/DTI friends/NNS in/IN a/AT small/JJ private/JJ airplane/NN with/IN a/AT single/AP engine/NN ./.

All/ABN had/HVD fallen/VBN into/IN a/AT complete/JJ silence/NN ,/, listening/VBG to/IN the/AT wind/NN whistle/NN over/IN the/AT wings/NNS ./.

The/AT pilot/NN had/HVD been/BEN good/JJ ./.

He'd/PPS+HVD landed/VBN the/AT plane/NN on/IN a/AT small/JJ airstrip/NN in/IN Connecticut/NP and/CC as/QL soon/RB as/CS the/AT aircraft/NN had/HVD coasted/VBN to/IN a/AT stop/NN ,/, everyone/PN had/HVD burst/VBN into/IN chatter/NN at/IN the/AT same/AP moment/NN ./.

The/AT same/AP taut-nerved/JJ relationship/NN as/CS there/EX had/HVD been/BEN between/IN the/AT passengers/NNS on/IN the/AT plane/NN now/RB strained/VBD at/IN the/AT three/CD of/IN them/PPO here/RB on/IN the/AT boat/NN ./.

It/PPS hung/VBD over/IN them/PPO like/CS a/AT cloud/NN ,/, its/PP$ arrival/NN as/QL sudden/JJ as/CS a/AT cloud/NN skidding/VBG over/IN the/AT sun/NN ./.

Silently/RB ,/, Elaine/NP picked/VBD up/RP her/PP$ keys/NNS from/IN the/AT table/NN and/CC went/VBD out/RP into/IN the/AT cockpit/NN ,/, Poet/NN behind/IN her/PPO ,/, Nick/NP trailing/VBG behind/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` It's/PPS+BEZ quite/QL possible/JJ there's/EX+BEZ more/AP than/IN codfish/NN down/RP there/RB ,/, man/NN ''/'' ,/, Poet/NN replied/VBD with/IN a/AT short/JJ ,/, nervous/JJ laugh/NN as/CS he/PPS held/VBD the/AT harness/NN for/IN Elaine/NP ./.

A/AT moment/NN later/RBR ,/, moving/VBG awkwardly/RB because/CS of/IN the/AT swimming/VBG fins/NNS ,/, she/PPS picked/VBD up/RP the/AT gun/NN ,/, handed/VBD the/AT knife/NN to/IN Poet/NN ,/, then/RB rolled/VBD off/IN the/AT transom/NN of/IN the/AT boat/NN ,/, back/NN first/RB ./.

They/PPSS remained/VBD close/JJ together/RB ,/, their/PP$ air/NN trail/NN wiggling/VBG like/CS serpents/NNS traveling/VBG side/NN by/IN side/NN ./.

Eventually/RB the/AT bubbles/NNS became/VBD lost/VBN in/IN the/AT sparkle/NN of/IN the/AT ocean/NN surface/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS rolled/VBD over/RP on/IN his/PP$ back/NN ./.

Off/RP to/IN the/AT west/NR a/AT beautiful/JJ schooner/NN slowly/RB beat/VB its/PP$ way/NN into/IN the/AT wind/NN ,/, headed/VBN on/IN a/AT tack/NN toward/IN San/NP Clemente/NP ./.

Behind/IN it/PPO a/AT cabin/NN cruiser/NN drifted/VBD crossways/RB in/IN the/AT small/JJ ground-swell/NN ,/, a/AT lone/JJ fisherman/NN in/IN the/AT chair/NN aft/RB ./.

The/AT fisherman/NN was/BEDZ right/QL in/IN the/AT middle/NN of/IN the/AT Deep/NN ./.

Nick/NP recalled/VBD stories/NNS that/CS the/AT two/CD best/JJT fishing/VBG spots/NNS in/IN Southern/JJ California/NP were/BED over/IN the/AT La/NP Jolla/NP Deep/NN and/CC the/AT Redondo/NP Deep/NN ,/, two/CD spots/NNS where/WRB the/AT ocean/NN dropped/VBD off/RP to/IN fantastic/JJ depths/NNS almost/RB from/IN the/AT shoreline/NN ./.

Someday/RB ,/, geologists/NNS had/HVD warned/VBN ,/, the/AT land/NN on/IN both/ABX sides/NNS of/IN these/DTS deeps/NNS would/MD fall/VB into/IN the/AT ocean/NN and/CC no/AT more/AP La/NP Jolla/NP or/CC Redondo/NP Beach/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, fishermen/NNS took/VBD advantage/NN of/IN them/PPO to/TO pull/VB up/RP whoppers/NNS ./.

Sometimes/RB the/AT fish/NN exploded/VBD as/CS they/PPSS neared/VBD the/AT surface/NN because/CS of/IN the/AT difference/NN in/IN pressure/NN ./.

Why/WRB ,/, he/PPS wondered/VBD ,/, had/HVD Elaine/NP wanted/VBD him/PPO along/RB on/IN this/DT trip/NN ?/. ?/.

He/PPS couldn't/MD* skindive/VB ,/, he/PPS couldn't/MD* run/VB a/AT boat/NN ,/, except/IN on/IN the/AT open/JJ sea/NN ./.

He/PPS stood/VBD up/RP ,/, stretched/VBD ,/, looked/VBD around/RB for/IN the/AT bubbles/NNS ,/, but/CC could/MD see/VB none/PN ./.

Strolling/VBG down/RP to/IN the/AT galley/NN ,/, he/PPS lit/VBD the/AT butane/NN under/IN the/AT coffee/NN pot/NN and/CC when/WRB the/AT brew/NN was/BEDZ heated/VBN ,/, poured/VBD himself/PPL a/AT cup/NN and/CC went/VBD up/RP to/IN the/AT chartroom/NN ./.

Turning/VBG on/RP the/AT hi-fi/NN ,/, he/PPS went/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT cockpit/NN ,/, stretched/VBD out/RP on/IN the/AT cushions/NNS and/CC listened/VBD to/IN the/AT music/NN ./.

Elaine/NP and/CC Poet/NN returned/VBD together/RB ,/, popping/VBG up/RP over/IN the/AT transom/NN almost/RB like/CS dolphins/NNS breaking/VBG water/NN ./.

He/PPS sat/VBD up/RP and/CC watched/VBD as/CS they/PPSS pulled/VBD themselves/PPLS over/IN the/AT stern/NN ./.

``/`` Any/DTI luck/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

He/PPS asked/VBD ./.

Poet/NN shook/VBD his/PP$ head/NN ,/, sliding/VBG his/PP$ face/NN mask/NN up/RP on/IN his/PP$ forehead/NN ./.

``/`` We're/PPSS+BER right/QL on/IN the/AT edge/NN of/IN the/AT Deep/NN ''/'' ,/, Elaine/NP said/VBD ./.

Pulling/VBG off/RP her/PP$ face/NN mask/NN ,/, she/PPS carefully/RB placed/VBD the/AT spear/NN gun/NN across/IN the/AT stern/NN ,/, then/RB lifted/VBD her/PP$ wet/JJ hair/NN from/IN her/PPO back/NN and/CC squeezed/VBD out/RP the/AT water/NN ./.

``/`` Which/WDT is/BEZ a/AT break/NN as/CS the/AT area/NN to/IN search/NN is/BEZ less/AP than/IN a/AT square/NN mile/NN ''/'' ,/, she/PPS added/VBD as/CS she/PPS swung/VBD her/PPO legs/NNS over/IN the/AT transom/NN ./.

``/`` Any/DTI news/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

He/PPS tossed/VBD her/PPO a/AT towel/NN ,/, then/RB repeated/VBD the/AT service/NN for/IN Poet/NN ./.

``/`` Cigarette/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Elaine/NP shook/VBD her/PPO head/NN as/CS she/PPS slipped/VBD out/RP of/IN her/PPO harness/NN ,/, but/CC Poet/NN nodded/VBD ./.

His/PP$ feet/NNS still/RB hung/VBN over/IN the/AT stern/NN of/IN the/AT transom/NN ,/, but/CC as/CS he/PPS reached/VBD for/IN the/AT smoke/NN he/PPS raised/VBD them/PPO to/TO swing/VB them/PPO in/RP ./.

The/AT fin/NN on/IN his/PP$ foot/NN caught/VBD on/IN the/AT moulding/NN ,/, throwing/VBG him/PPO off/IN balance/NN ./.

His/PP$ forearm/NN smashed/VBD painfully/RB into/IN the/AT narrow/JJ washboard/NN and/CC he/PPS grimaced/VBD as/CS he/PPS grabbed/VBD his/PP$ bruised/VBN limb/NN with/IN his/PP$ other/AP hand/NN and/CC rolled/VBD into/IN the/AT boat/NN ./.

``/`` Kee-reist/UH ''/'' !/. !/.

The/AT word/NN hissed/VBD distinctly/RB from/IN Poet's/NN$ lips/NNS as/CS he/PPS struggled/VBD to/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS ./.

Nick's/NP$ body/NN became/VBD rigid/JJ ./.

Turning/VBG slowly/RB he/PPS saw/VBD Poet/NN in/IN a/AT brilliant/JJ glare/NN of/IN horror/NN ./.

Poet/NN !/. !/.

His/PP$ face/NN was/BEDZ still/RB creased/VBN in/IN pain/NN as/CS he/PPS studied/VBD the/AT underside/NN of/IN his/PP$ arm/NN ./.

Turning/VBG quickly/RB toward/IN Elaine/NP ,/, Nick/NP saw/VBD that/CS she/PPS ,/, too/RB ,/, stood/VBD in/IN shocked/VBN surprise/NN ./.

The/AT sudden/JJ silence/NN was/BEDZ too/QL silent/JJ ./.

Instinctively/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/AT charged/VBN atmosphere/NN ,/, Poet/NN raised/VBD his/PP$ head/NN slowly/RB ,/, looking/VBG first/RB at/IN Elaine/NP ./.

She/PPS had/HVD caught/VBN the/AT implication/NN of/IN the/AT oath/NN ./.

Her/PP$ face/NN was/BEDZ frozen/VBN into/IN the/AT mask/NN of/IN a/AT mannequin/NN ,/, her/PP$ body/NN absolutely/QL motionless/JJ ./.

And/CC then/JJ Nick/NP knew/VBD that/CS all/ABN of/IN them/PPO knew/VBD Elaine/NP ,/, himself/PPL and/CC Poet/NN ./.

Elaine/NP recovered/VBD first/RB ,/, so/QL quickly/RB that/CS Nick/NP thought/VBD he/PPS might/MD have/HV imagined/VBN her/PP$ sudden/JJ reaction/NN ./.

``/`` Do/DO you/PPSS need/VB a/AT bandage/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

She/PPS asked/VBD steadily/RB ./.

Poet/NN rubbed/VBD his/PP$ arm/NN ./.

``/`` It's/PPS+BEZ like/CS banging/VBG a/AT shin/NN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ,/, his/PP$ eyes/NNS lingered/VBD on/IN Nick's/NP$ face/NN ,/, then/RB moved/VBD back/RB to/IN Elaine/NP ./.

``/`` Hurts/NNS like/CS hell/NN for/IN a/AT second/NN ,/, then/RB it/PPS disappears/VBZ ''/'' ./.

``/`` I'll/PPSS+MD get/VB some/DTI ointment/NN ''/'' ./.

Elaine/NP turned/VBD and/CC started/VBD toward/IN the/AT companionway/NN ./.

But/CC her/PP$ walk/NN was/BEDZ too/QL steady/JJ ,/, too/QL slow/JJ ,/, telegraphing/VBG her/PP$ fear/NN ./.

Nick/NP sensed/VBD it/PPO ./.

So/RB did/DOD Poet/NN ./.

Springing/VBG like/CS a/AT cat/NN ,/, he/PPS leaped/VBD back/RB ,/, swooped/VBD up/RP the/AT spring/NN gun/NN and/CC ,/, whirling/VBG ,/, pointed/VBD it/PPO toward/IN the/AT cabin/NN ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP instant/NN ,/, Nick/NP hit/VBD the/AT barrel/NN and/CC threw/VBD himself/PPL upon/IN the/AT smaller/JJR man/NN ./.

The/AT gun/NN fired/VBD next/IN to/IN his/PP$ ear/NN with/IN a/AT vicious/JJ whoosh/UH like/CS the/AT first/OD stroke/NN of/IN an/AT old/JJ steam/NN engine/NN ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP instant/NN ,/, Elaine/NP screamed/VBD wildly/RB ,/, the/AT sound/NN ending/VBG abruptly/RB as/CS Nick/NP went/VBD off/IN the/AT boat/NN and/CC into/IN the/AT water/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN the/AT frantic/JJ ,/, struggling/VBG Poet/NN ./.

The/AT moment/NN the/AT sea/NN closed/VBD over/IN Nick/NP ,/, some/DTI atavistic/JJ sense/NN warned/VBD him/PPO that/CS he/PPS would/MD survive/VB in/IN this/DT alien/JJ element/NN only/RB if/CS he/PPS did/DOD not/* panic/VB ./.

But/CC the/AT murderer/NN to/IN whom/WPO he/PPS clung/VBD had/HVD a/AT tremendous/JJ advantage/NN ./.

The/AT wide/JJ flippers/NNS on/IN Poet's/NN$ feet/NNS gave/VBD his/PP$ legs/NNS incredible/JJ power/NN ,/, driving/VBG the/AT two/CD of/IN them/PPO down/RP into/IN the/AT water/NN as/CS they/PPSS rolled/VBD over/RP and/CC over/RP ./.

Poet/NN was/BEDZ the/AT captured/VBN ,/, arms/NNS pinioned/VBN to/IN his/PP$ side/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS twisted/VBD convulsively/RB trying/VBG to/TO escape/VB ./.

Poet/NN would/MD escape/VB ,/, Nick/NP thought/VBD grimly/RB ,/, because/CS he/PPS wore/VBD the/AT apparatus/NN which/WDT would/MD keep/VB him/PPO alive/JJ under/IN water/NN ./.

But/CC Nick/NP would/MD not/* let/VB go/VB ./.

The/AT rubber/NN and/CC glass/NN face/NN mask/NN slipped/VBD from/IN Poet's/NN$ forehead/NN ,/, bounced/VBD painlessly/RB off/IN Nick's/NP$ chin/NN ,/, then/RB disappeared/VBD ./.

Poet/NN twisted/VBD again/RB and/CC Nick's/NP$ knuckles/NNS scraped/VBD on/IN the/AT air/NN tank/NN ,/, ripping/VBG off/RP the/AT skin/NN ./.

For/CS a/AT split/VBN second/NN ,/, Nick/NP relaxed/VBD his/PP$ grip/NN and/CC Poet's/NN$ slippery/JJ body/NN spun/VBD completely/RB around/RB before/CS Nick/NP could/MD stop/VB him/PPO ,/, holding/VBG him/PPO now/RB from/IN the/AT rear/NN ./.

Something/PN flailed/VBD at/IN the/AT side/NN of/IN Nick's/NP$ head/NN as/CS they/PPSS rolled/VBD around/RB and/CC around/RB ./.

Suddenly/RB Poet/NN stopped/VBD struggling/VBG and/CC the/AT two/CD of/IN them/PPO hung/VBN suspended/VBN in/IN the/AT water/NN ,/, not/* rising/VBG ,/, not/* sinking/VBG ./.

A/AT sharp/JJ pain/NN lanced/VBD across/IN Nick's/NP$ chest/NN and/CC a/AT bubble/NN of/IN air/NN escaped/VBD from/IN his/PP$ tortured/VBN lungs/NNS ,/, joining/VBG dozens/NNS of/IN others/NNS that/WPS sailed/VBD lazily/RB toward/IN the/AT surface/NN like/CS helium/NN balloons/NNS rising/VBG into/IN the/AT sky/NN ./.

A/AT black/JJ ,/, snake-like/JJ object/NN swayed/VBD eerily/RB in/IN front/NN of/IN him/PPO ,/, spewing/VBG bubbles/NNS from/IN its/PP$ flat/JJ cobra/NN head/NN ./.

The/AT air/NN hose/NN was/BEDZ free/JJ !/. !/.

The/AT discovery/NN struck/VBD Nick/NP like/CS a/AT blow/NN ./.

Desperately/RB ,/, Nick/NP flashed/VBD one/CD hand/NN up/RP ,/, catching/VBG Poet's/NN$ neck/NN in/IN the/AT bend/NN of/IN his/PP$ elbow/NN ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP instant/NN ,/, he/PPS grabbed/VBD the/AT loose/JJ ,/, writhing/VBG hose/NN with/IN his/PP$ other/AP hand/NN and/CC bit/VBD down/RP on/IN the/AT hard/JJ rubber/NN mouthpiece/NN ./.

Instinctively/RB he/PPS exhaled/VBD through/IN his/PP$ nose/NN then/RB sucked/VBD in/RP the/AT air/NN from/IN the/AT hose/NN ./.

At/IN once/CS the/AT excruciating/JJ pain/NN in/IN his/PP$ chest/NN stopped/VBD and/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ seized/VBN with/IN a/AT sudden/JJ ,/, wild/JJ exultation/NN ./.

As/CS if/CS this/DT was/BEDZ a/AT signal/NN ,/, Poet/NN abruptly/RB began/VBD to/TO thrash/VB the/AT water/NN and/CC the/AT quick/JJ movement/NN slowly/RB made/VBD them/PPO sink/VB through/IN the/AT water/NN ./.

Relentlessly/RB ,/, Nick/NP held/VBD on/RP ,/, sucking/VBG on/IN the/AT hose/NN ,/, inhaling/VBG the/AT air/NN that/WPS belonged/VBD to/IN Poet/NN ./.

A/AT few/AP snowflakes/NNS sifted/VBD down/RP through/IN that/DT theatrical/JJ red/JJ glow/NN ,/, languid/JJ as/CS falling/VBG feathers/NNS ./.

He/PPS crawled/VBD into/IN bed/NN and/CC switched/VBD off/RP the/AT light/NN ./.

In/IN the/AT darkness/NN he/PPS could/MD see/VB the/AT rosy/JJ reflection/NN of/IN the/AT neon/NN sign/NN on/IN the/AT wall/NN opposite/IN the/AT window/NN ./.

It/PPS winked/VBD as/QL steadily/RB as/CS a/AT metronome/NN --/-- on/RP ,/, off/RP --/-- on/RP ,/, off/RP ./.

In/IN less/AP than/IN five/CD minutes/NNS Alec/NP was/BEDZ asleep/RB ./.

He/PPS never/RB knew/VBD just/RB what/WDT woke/VBD him/PPO ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT sound/NN and/CC apparently/RB no/AT movement/NN in/IN the/AT room/NN except/IN the/AT noiseless/JJ pulsation/NN of/IN the/AT red/JJ light/NN on/IN the/AT wall/NN ./.

He/PPS lay/VBD still/RB ,/, listening/VBG to/IN the/AT silence/NN ,/, watching/VBG the/AT light/NN ./.

Somewhere/RB in/IN the/AT city/NN a/AT big/JJ clock/NN sounded/VBD twelve/CD solemn/JJ notes/NNS --/-- midnight/NN ./.

According/IN to/IN the/AT medical/JJ examiner/NN she/PPS was/BEDZ shot/VBN between/IN eleven/CD p.m./RB and/CC one/CD a.m./RB ./.

Alec/NP heard/VBD a/AT faint/JJ sound/NN ./.

His/PP$ heart/NN seemed/VBD to/TO swell/VB and/CC knock/VB against/IN the/AT wall/NN of/IN his/PP$ chest/NN ./.

For/CS the/AT sound/NN was/BEDZ inside/IN the/AT room/NN ./.

He/PPS let/VBD his/PP$ eyelids/NNS droop/VB and/CC breathed/VBD heavily/RB ,/, feigning/VBG sleep/NN ./.

The/AT sound/NN was/BEDZ coming/VBG nearer/RBR ./.

A/AT monstrous/JJ shadow/NN fell/VBD across/IN the/AT illuminated/VBN wall/NN ,/, distorted/VBN and/CC indefinable/JJ ./.

When/WRB the/AT neon/NN sign/NN faded/VBD out/RP ,/, the/AT shadow/NN disappeared/VBD ./.

It/PPS stretched/VBD to/IN an/AT impossible/JJ height/NN ,/, climbing/VBG the/AT wall/NN to/IN the/AT ceiling/NN ./.

That/DT meant/VBD that/CS something/PN between/IN the/AT light/NN and/CC its/PP$ reflection/NN on/IN the/AT wall/NN was/BEDZ moving/VBG closer/RBR to/IN the/AT source/NN of/IN the/AT light/NN --/-- in/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/AT window/NN ./.

Cautiously/RB Alec/NP tensed/VBD his/PP$ muscles/NNS ,/, ready/JJ to/TO jump/VB ./.

The/AT bedsprings/NNS betrayed/VBD him/PPO with/IN a/AT creak/NN ./.

The/AT shadow/NN vanished/VBD ./.

Someone/PN had/HVD moved/VBN beyond/IN the/AT range/NN of/IN the/AT light/NN from/IN the/AT window/NN ./.

Abandoning/VBG caution/NN ,/, Alec/NP leaped/VBD out/IN of/IN bed/NN and/CC groped/VBD for/IN the/AT light/NN switch/NN ./.

Before/CS he/PPS could/MD snap/VB it/PPO on/RP ,/, a/AT stinging/VBG blow/NN caught/VBD him/PPO in/IN the/AT ribs/NNS ./.

He/PPS lashed/VBD out/RP blindly/RB with/IN his/PP$ right/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT thick/JJ ,/, squashy/JJ crack/NN of/IN fist/NN on/IN flesh/NN ./.

Something/PN hard/JJ grazed/VBN his/PP$ knuckles/NNS ./.

He/PPS put/VBD everything/PN he/PPS had/HVD into/IN the/AT next/AP and/CC aimed/VBD down/RP where/WRB the/AT stomach/NN ought/MD to/TO be/BE ./.

Rough/JJ cloth/NN rasped/VBD his/PP$ fist/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT grunt/NN ,/, curiously/RB inarticulate/JJ ,/, like/CS that/DT of/IN an/AT animal/NN in/IN pain/NN ./.

Something/PN heavy/JJ shook/VBD the/AT floor/NN as/CS it/PPS dropped/VBD ./.

Alec/NP waited/VBD a/AT moment/NN ,/, on/IN guard/NN ./.

Nothing/PN happened/VBD ./.

Again/RB he/PPS groped/VBD for/IN the/AT light/NN switch/NN ./.

The/AT blue/JJ rug/NN had/HVD been/BEN rolled/VBN up/RP and/CC stacked/VBN in/IN one/CD corner/NN of/IN the/AT room/NN ./.

On/IN the/AT bare/JJ floorboards/NNS a/AT man/NN lay/VBD face/NN down/RP ./.

He/PPS had/HVD a/AT short/JJ ,/, heavy/JJ ,/, powerful/JJ body/NN ./.

Alec/NP turned/VBD him/PPO over/RP and/CC discovered/VBD a/AT round/JJ ,/, lumpy/JJ face/NN with/IN narrow/JJ ,/, slanting/VBG eyes/NNS --/-- a/AT primitive/JJ Tartar/NP face/NN from/IN Russia/NP or/CC the/AT Balkans/NPS ./.

The/AT man's/NN$ shoes/NNS were/BED too/QL pointed/VBN ,/, his/PP$ overcoat/NN too/QL broad/JJ at/IN the/AT shoulders/NNS and/CC too/QL narrow/JJ at/IN the/AT waist/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT slight/JJ bulge/NN under/IN the/AT left/JJ armpit/NN --/-- a/AT shoulder/NN holster/NN ./.

Alec/NP promptly/RB removed/VBD the/AT gun/NN ./.

But/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ surprised/VBN to/TO meet/VB it/PPO here/RB ./.

Diana/NP Beauclerk/NP had/HVD no/AT connection/NN with/IN the/AT underworld/NN ./.

A/AT professional/JJ gunman/NN would/MD not/* have/HV killed/VBN her/PPO with/IN a/AT weapon/NN of/IN such/JJ small/JJ caliber/NN as/CS a/AT

Nor/CC would/MD he/PPS choose/VB a/AT respectable/JJ hotel/NN as/CS the/AT scene/NN for/IN a/AT killing/NN when/WRB it/PPS would/MD be/BE so/QL much/QL safer/JJR to/TO take/VB his/PP$ victim/NN for/IN a/AT one-way/NN ride/NN on/IN a/AT lonely/JJ country/NN road/NN ./.

The/AT man's/NN$ eyelids/NNS fluttered/VBD ./.

``/`` What/WDT are/BER you/PPSS doing/VBG here/RB ''/'' ?/. ?/.

The/AT quarrel/NN ended/VBD in/IN a/AT ridiculous/JJ draw/NN ,/, but/CC I/PPSS must/MD tell/VB you/PPO about/IN it/PPO ./.

Oh/UH ,/, yes/RB ,/, I'm/PPSS+BEM quite/QL sure/JJ it's/PPS+BEZ important/JJ ,/, because/CS of/IN the/AT Beech/NN Pasture/NN ./.

What's/WDT+BEZ that/DT ?/. ?/.

Why/WRB ,/, that's/DT+BEZ what/WDT gave/VBD me/PPO the/AT feeling/NN ,/, gave/VBD me/PPO as-it-were/RB the/AT spirit/NN ,/, the/AT demoniac/JJ ,/, evil/JJ spirit/NN of/IN this/DT whole/NN affair/NN ./.

You/PPSS see/VB ,/, besides/RB being/BEG custodian/NN of/IN antiquities/NNS ,/, I/PPSS am/BEM also/RB registrar/NN ./.

No/RB ,/, I/PPSS don't/DO* hold/VB with/IN those/DTS who/WPS live/VB entirely/RB among/IN dead/JJ things/NNS ./.

But/CC you've/PPSS+HV got/VBN to/TO know/VB both/ABX ./.

What's/WDT+BEZ below/IN the/AT water-line/NN interests/VBZ me/PPO also/RB ./.

As/CS I/PPSS was/BEDZ saying/VBG ,/, I've/PPSS+HV known/VBN all/ABN about/IN the/AT old/JJ records/NNS ,/, including/IN the/AT old/JJ Norberg/NP deed/NN ./.

Some/DTI ten/CD years/NNS ago/RB that/DT page/NN was/BEDZ torn/VBN out/RP ,/, I/PPSS don't/DO* know/VB by/IN whom/WPO ./.

About/RB five/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, Handley/NP came/VBD to/TO ask/VB me/PPO if/CS he/PPS could/MD see/VB the/AT tattered/VBN register/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ courteous/JJ and/CC casual/JJ about/IN it/PPO ,/, as/CS though/CS it/PPS were/BED of/IN no/AT consequence/NN ./.

He's/PPS+HVZ always/RB like/CS that/DT ,/, in/IN spite/IN of/IN being/BEG a/AT big/JJ man/NN ./.

(/( When/WRB you/PPSS see/VB him/PPO ,/, you'll/PPSS+MD notice/VB his/PP$ habit/NN of/IN fingering/VBG ,/, I/PPSS might/MD almost/RB say/VB ,/, stroking/VBG a/AT large/JJ mole/NN with/IN black/JJ hairs/NNS on/IN it/PPO ,/, by/IN his/PP$ right/JJ temple/NN ./.

)/) A/AT sensual/JJ man/NN ,/, but/CC very/QL courteous/JJ ,/, some/DTI would/MD say/VB slick/JJ ./.

Like/CS his/PP$ glossy/JJ black/JJ hair/NN ./.

Too/QL many/AP outside/JJ manners/NNS ,/, to/IN my/PP$ taste/NN ./.

He/PPS is/BEZ the/AT sort/NN who/WPS ,/, with/IN an/AT appraising/VBG eye/NN ,/, would/MD cross/VB the/AT street/NN to/TO help/VB a/AT strange/JJ woman/NN on/IN to/IN a/AT bus/NN and/CC then/RB pinch/VB her/PPO ./.

A/AT real/JJ gentleman/NN ,/, I/PPSS feel/VB ,/, would/MD do/DO neither/DTX ./.

He's/PPS+HVZ always/RB worn/VBN a/AT broad-brimmed/JJ hat/NN ,/, and/CC I've/PPSS+HV noticed/VBN ,/, in/IN my/PP$ small/JJ study/NN at/IN the/AT Society/NN ,/, that/CS he/PPS rather/RB smells/VBZ of/IN cosmetics/NNS ./.

The/AT next/AP week/NN ,/, cousin/NN Red/NP wandered/VBD in/RP as/QL casually/RB ,/, but/CC curt/JJ and/CC untidy/JJ ./.

Red/NP was/BEDZ small/JJ and/CC fine-boned/JJ ,/, like/CS ivory-inlay/NN ./.

He/PPS too/RB asked/VBD to/TO see/VB the/AT same/AP page/NN ./.

When/WRB I/PPSS told/VBD him/PPO someone/PN had/HVD torn/VBN it/PPO out/RP ,/, he/PPS shouted/VBD ./.

``/`` By/IN God/NP ,/, it's/PPS+BEZ that/DT damn/JJ Handley/NP ,/, the/AT sneak/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

And/CC later/RBR in/IN the/AT same/AP week/NN they/PPSS both/ABX came/VBD together/RB to/TO examine/VB the/AT register/NN ./.

Fortunately/RB we/PPSS were/BED alone/RB in/IN the/AT building/NN --/-- so/QL few/AP people/NNS nowadays/RB are/BER interested/VBN even/RB in/IN their/PP$ own/JJ past/NN or/CC in/IN the/AT lovely/JJ craft/NN of/IN other/AP days/NNS --/-- for/CS they/PPSS began/VBD to/TO abuse/VB each/DT other/AP in/IN the/AT foulest/JJT language/NN ./.

Red/JJ thrusting/VBG out/RP his/PP$ tawny/JJ beard/NN ,/, Handley/NP glowering/VBG under/IN his/PP$ suddenly/RB rumpled/VBN black/JJ hair/NN ./.

They/PPSS actually/RB bristled/VBD ./.

Le/AT rouge/NN et/CC le/AT noir/JJ ./.

Violent/JJ men/NNS both/ABX ./.

Red/JJ always/RB was/BEDZ morose/JJ ,/, yet/RB that/DT day/NN the/AT dapper/JJ Handley/NP was/BEDZ the/AT louder/JJR of/IN the/AT two/CD ./.

But/IN for/IN my/PP$ presence/NN ,/, they/PPSS would/MD have/HV been/BEN at/IN each/DT others'/NNS$ throats/NNS ./.

During/IN the/AT quarrel/NN I/PPSS learned/VBD what/WDT the/AT trouble/NN was/BEDZ ,/, from/IN the/AT accusations/NNS each/DT hurled/VBD at/IN the/AT other/AP ./.

The/AT Beech/NN Pasture/NN had/HVD suddenly/RB become/VBN valuable/JJ ./.

There's/EX+BEZ a/AT fine/JJ granite/NN quarry/NN there/RB ,/, and/CC granite's/NN+BEZ coming/VBG back/RB for/IN public/JJ buildings/NNS ./.

Both/ABX men/NNS knew/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN the/AT Norberg/NP family/NN holdings/NNS ,/, but/CC to/IN which/WDT of/IN the/AT cousins/NNS did/DOD it/PPS belong/VB ,/, Anta/NP or/CC Freya/NP ?/. ?/.

Fortunately/RB ,/, I/PPSS knew/VBD almost/RB exactly/RB what/WDT the/AT will/NN had/HVD said/VBN ./.

It/PPS began/VBD with/IN a/AT preamble/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ./.

This/DT explained/VBD that/CS the/AT judge/NN of/IN probate/NN of/IN Essex/NP County/NN ,/, 1785/CD or/CC 1786/CD ,/, appointed/VBD three/CD free-holders/NNS of/IN Gloucester/NP to/TO divide/VB and/CC establish/VB the/AT Norberg/NP estate/NN ./.

After/IN the/AT usual/JJ Honorable/JJ Sirs/NNS ,/, it/PPS went/VBD on/RP to/TO say/VB that/CS there/EX had/HVD been/BEN set/VBN off/RP to/IN the/AT widow/NN one/CD full/JJ third/OD part/NN of/IN the/AT real/JJ estate/NN of/IN the/AT deceased/JJ Salu/NP Norberg/NP ,/, one/CD lower/JJR room/NN ,/, on/IN the/AT Western/JJ side/NN ,/, privileges/NNS to/IN the/AT well/NN and/CC bake-oven/NN and/CC to/IN one/CD third/OD of/IN the/AT cellar/NN (/( I/PPSS can/MD show/VB you/PPO the/AT cellar/NN when/WRB we/PPSS go/VB up/RP )/) ,/, also/RB one/CD Cow/NN Right/NN ,/, and/CC lastly/RB they/PPSS set/VBD off/RP to/IN the/AT widow/NN her/PP$ own/JJ land/NN that/CS she/PPS brought/VBD with/IN her/PPO as/CS dower/NN ,/, namely/RB the/AT Beech/NN Pasture/NN ./.

And/CC I/PPSS remember/VB that/CS the/AT whole/NN of/IN the/AT privileges/NNS ,/, not/* counting/VBG the/AT Beech/NN Pasture/NN ,/, was/BEDZ valued/VBN at/IN twenty/CD pounds/NNS ./.

I/PPSS wish/VB you/PPSS could/MD have/HV seen/VBN the/AT crests/NNS fall/VB on/IN these/DTS two/CD sparring/VBG coxcombs/NNS when/WRB I/PPSS told/VBD them/PPO that/CS obviously/RB the/AT pasture/NN belonged/VBD to/IN their/PP$ wives/NNS jointly/RB ./.

That/DT battle/NN scene/NN ,/, ridiculous/JJ as/CS it/PPO was/BEDZ ,/, remained/VBD in/IN my/PP$ mind/NN ./.

A/AT disturbing/JJ picture/NN of/IN bad/JJ blood/NN ,/, to/TO be/BE further/JJR heightened/VBN with/IN illicit/JJ if/CS buccolic/JJ colors/NNS ,/, for/CS on/IN a/AT subsequent/JJ day/NN I/PPSS saw/VBD Handley/NP escorting/VBG Anta/NP ,/, Red's/NP$ wife/NN ,/, up/RP on/IN Dogtown/NP Common/NN ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD it/PPS would/MD be/BE inopportune/JJ to/TO disclose/VB my/PP$ presence/NN ./.

Not/* that/CS I/PPSS intentionally/RB go/VB unperceived/JJ ,/, but/CC the/AT boulders/NNS up/RP there/RB are/BER very/QL high/JJ and/CC I/PPSS am/BEM a/AT small/JJ woman/NN ./.

One/CD other/AP cause/NN of/IN jealousy/NN between/IN them/PPO I/PPSS must/MD tell/VB you/PPO ./.

Paint/NN !/. !/.

Gloomy/JJ and/CC unkempt/JJ as/CS Red/JJ McIver/NP was/BEDZ ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ much/RB the/AT better/JJR painter/NN ./.

I/PPSS suppose/VB Handley/NP knew/VBD it/PPO ./.

If/CS Red/NP had/HVD a/AT show/NN at/IN Gloucester/NP ,/, Handley/NP would/MD hurry/VB to/TO hang/VB his/PP$ pictures/NNS in/IN Rockport/NP ./.

You/PPSS may/MD say/VB this/DT has/HVZ little/AP pertinence/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, gentlemen/NNS ,/, remember/VB that/CS all/ABN this/DT prepared/VBD my/PP$ mind/NN ,/, alerted/VBD my/PP$ intelligence/NN ./.

By/IN such/JJ touches/NNS the/AT pattern/NN takes/VBZ shape/NN ./.

You/PPSS would/MD call/VB these/DTS the/AT motives/NNS of/IN crime/NN ./.

I/PPSS would/MD call/VB them/PPO the/AT patterns/NNS of/IN life/NN ,/, perhaps/RB even/RB the/AT designs/NNS of/IN destiny/NN ./.

Yet/RB with/IN all/ABN this/DT knowledge/NN I/PPSS had/HVD nothing/PN of/IN substance/NN to/TO unravel/VB our/PP$ case/NN ,/, as/CS you/PPSS would/MD call/VB it/PPO ,/, till/IN yesterday/NR ./.

One/CD month/NN ago/RB ,/, on/IN the/AT 20th/OD of/IN October/NP ,/, was/BEDZ the/AT opening/NN of/IN the/AT gunning/VBG season/NN in/IN Massachusetts/NP ./.

Not/* much/AP to/TO shoot/VB ,/, but/CC there/EX are/BER a/AT few/AP pheasant/NNS ./.

Rabbits/NNS ,/, too/RB ,/, if/CS you/PPSS care/VB for/IN them/PPO ,/, which/WDT most/AP of/IN the/AT folk/NN around/IN here/RB haven't/HV* the/AT sense/NN to/TO appreciate/VB ./.

Any/DTI more/RBR than/CS they/PPSS have/HV the/AT sense/NN to/TO eat/VB mussels/NNS ./.

That/DT was/BEDZ the/AT day/NN Red/NP was/BEDZ said/VBN to/TO have/HV gone/VBN away/RB ./.

Oh/UH yes/RB ,/, he'd/PPS+HVD talked/VBN about/IN doing/VBG so/RB ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, he/PPS often/RB disappeared/VBD ,/, from/IN time/NN to/IN time/NN ,/, --/-- off/RP to/TO paint/VB the/AT sea/NN ,/, aboard/RB a/AT dragger/NN out/RP from/IN Gloucester/NP ./.

Anta/NP ,/, his/PP$ wife/NN ,/, never/RB seemed/VBD to/TO mind/VB ./.

I/PPSS suppose/VB these/DTS absences/NNS gave/VBD her/PPO more/AP clearance/NN for/IN her/PP$ embraces/NNS with/IN Cousin/NN Handley/NP ./.

Anyhow/RB ,/, I/PPSS wasn't/BEDZ* surprised/VBN ,/, early/RB that/DT morning/NN ,/, to/TO see/VB Handley/NP himself/PPL crossing/VBG from/IN Dogtown/NP Common/NN Road/NN to/IN the/AT Back/JJ Road/NN ./.

No/RB ,/, he/PPS didn't/DOD* have/HV his/PP$ gun/NN ,/, which/WDT he/PPS should/MD have/HV ./.

It/PPS would/MD have/HV been/BEN a/AT good/JJ excuse/NN for/IN his/PP$ being/BEG there/RB at/IN all/ABN ./.

I/PPSS myself/PPL had/HVD been/BEN up/RP there/RB by/IN seven/CD o'clock/RB ,/, after/IN mushrooms/NNS ,/, since/CS there'd/EX+HVD been/BEN a/AT week/NN of/IN rain/NN which/WDT had/HVD stopped/VBN early/RB that/DT morning/NN and/CC the/AT day/NN was/BEDZ as/QL clear/JJ as/CS Sandwich/NP glass/NN ./.

That's/DT+BEZ what/WDT the/AT man/NN had/HVD said/VBN ./.

Haney/NP peered/VBD doubtfully/RB at/IN his/PP$ drinking/VBG companion/NN through/IN bleary/JJ ,/, tear-filled/JJ eyes/NNS ./.

He/PPS had/HVD no/AT ready/JJ answer/NN ,/, as/QL much/RB from/IN surprise/NN as/CS from/IN the/AT fit/NN of/IN coughing/VBG ./.

Was/BEDZ the/AT man/NN drunk/JJ or/CC crazy/JJ or/CC both/ABX ?/. ?/.

But/CC his/PP$ new-found/JJ buddy/NN had/HVD matched/VBN him/PPO drink/NN for/IN drink/NN until/CS he/PPS lost/VBD count/NN ,/, and/CC the/AT man's/NN$ eyes/NNS were/BED still/RB clear/JJ ./.

The/AT guy/NN is/BEZ off/IN his/PP$ rocker/NN ,/, Haney/NP thought/VBD to/IN himself/PPL ,/, and/CC looked/VBD away/RB from/IN those/DTS eyes/NNS ./.

Eyes/NNS that/WPS were/BED clear/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB bright/JJ with/IN a/AT strange/JJ intensity/NN ,/, a/AT sort/NN of/IN cold/JJ fire/NN burning/VBG behind/IN them/PPO ./.

Why/WRB hadn't/HVD* he/PPS noticed/VBN it/PPO before/RB ?/. ?/.

No/RB ,/, the/AT man/NN was/BEDZ not/* drunk/JJ

He/PPS wondered/VBD how/WRB he/PPS got/VBD tied/VBN up/RP with/IN this/DT stranger/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, he/PPS remembered/VBD now/RB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ blurred/VBN ,/, after/IN two/CD hours/NNS of/IN steady/JJ drinking/NN ,/, but/CC the/AT occasion/NN of/IN it/PPO came/VBD back/RB to/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT stranger/NN ,/, his/PP$ head/NN seemingly/RB sunk/VBN in/IN thought/NN ,/, started/VBD to/TO cross/VB the/AT street/NN against/IN the/AT light/NN just/RB as/CS a/AT huge/JJ moving/VBG van/NN roared/VBD through/IN the/AT intersection/NN ./.

Brakes/NNS howled/VBD and/CC a/AT horn/NN blared/VBD furiously/RB ,/, but/CC the/AT man/NN would/MD have/HV been/BEN hit/VBN if/CS Phil/NP hadn't/HVD* called/VBN out/RP to/IN him/PPO a/AT second/NN before/RB ./.

His/PP$ shout/NN had/HVD been/BEN involuntary/JJ ,/, something/PN anybody/PN might/MD have/HV done/VBN without/IN thinking/VBG ,/, on/IN the/AT spur/NN of/IN the/AT moment/NN ./.

As/CS a/AT matter/NN of/IN fact/NN ,/, he/PPS wouldn't/MD* have/HV cared/VBN at/IN all/ABN if/CS the/AT guy/NN had/HVD been/BEN hit/VBN ./.

Actually/RB ,/, he/PPS regretted/VBD having/HVG opened/VBN his/PP$ mouth/NN when/WRB the/AT truck/NN came/VBD to/IN a/AT stop/NN and/CC the/AT angry/JJ driver/NN jumped/VBD down/RP from/IN the/AT cab/NN and/CC walked/VBD back/RB toward/IN them/PPO ./.

By/IN then/RB ,/, the/AT stranger/NN was/BEDZ thanking/VBG Haney/NP profusely/RB and/CC had/HVD one/CD arm/NN around/IN his/PP$ shoulders/NNS as/CS if/CS he/PPS were/BED an/AT old/JJ friend/NN ./.

So/CS the/AT driver/NN started/VBD to/TO curse/VB at/IN both/ABX of/IN them/PPO as/CS if/CS they/PPSS had/HVD been/BEN in/IN a/AT plot/NN together/RB to/TO ruin/VB his/PP$ safe-driving/NN record/NN ./.

Then/RB the/AT man/NN he/PPS saved/VBD turned/VBD and/CC looked/VBD squarely/RB into/IN the/AT truck/NN driver's/NN$ face/NN ,/, without/IN saying/VBG a/AT word/NN ./.

Very/QL suddenly/RB ,/, the/AT driver/NN stopped/VBD swearing/VBG at/IN them/PPO ,/, turned/VBD on/IN his/PP$ heel/NN and/CC went/VBD back/RB to/IN his/PP$ truck/NN ./.

Haney/NP hadn't/HVD* given/VBN it/PPO much/AP thought/NN at/IN the/AT time/NN ./.

Now/RB he/PPS recalled/VBD it/PPO very/QL clearly/RB ,/, and/CC wondered/VBD what/WDT the/AT truck/NN driver/NN had/HVD seen/VBN in/IN those/DTS eyes/NNS to/TO make/VB him/PPO back/VB off/RP ./.

It/PPS must/MD have/HV been/BEN the/AT sort/NN of/IN look/NN that/WPS can/MD call/VB a/AT bluff/NN without/IN saying/VBG a/AT word/NN ./.

When/WRB the/AT light/NN went/VBD their/PP$ way/NN ,/, they/PPSS went/VBD on/RP across/IN the/AT street/NN ./.

And/CC when/WRB the/AT stranger/NN found/VBD out/RP that/CS Phil/NP was/BEDZ on/IN the/AT way/NN to/IN one/CD of/IN his/PP$ favorite/JJ bars/NNS ,/, he/PPS insisted/VBD on/IN offering/VBG to/TO buy/VB drinks/NNS for/IN both/ABX of/IN them/PPO ./.

Phil/NP usually/RB went/VBD alone/RB and/CC kept/VBD to/IN himself/PPL ,/, sitting/VBG in/IN a/AT corner/NN and/CC passing/VBG the/AT time/NN by/IN nursing/VBG his/PP$ favorite/JJ grudges/NNS ./.

But/CC he/PPS decided/VBD he/PPS wouldn't/MD* mind/VB company/NN in/IN return/NN for/IN free/JJ drinks/NNS ,/, even/RB though/CS he/PPS made/VBD good/JJ money/NN at/IN his/PP$ job/NN ./.

Phil/NP was/BEDZ like/CS that/DT ./.

Now/RB he/PPS wondered/VBD if/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ worth/JJ it/PPO ,/, having/HVG a/AT screwball/NN for/IN company/NN ./.

He/PPS really/RB didn't/DOD* take/VB the/AT offer/NN seriously/RB ,/, but/CC he/PPS began/VBD to/TO feel/VB uneasy/JJ ./.

When/WRB he/PPS finally/RB got/VBD the/AT coughing/NN under/IN control/NN ,/, he/PPS realized/VBD that/CS Pete/NP (/( all/ABN he/PPS gave/VBD was/BEDZ his/PP$ first/OD name/NN )/) was/BEDZ still/RB waiting/VBG for/IN an/AT answer/NN --/-- he/PPS didn't/DOD* even/RB seem/VB to/TO wink/VB as/CS he/PPS continued/VBD to/TO stare/VB ./.

Haney/NP managed/VBD a/AT weak/JJ laugh/NN ./.

``/`` Guess/VB I/PPSS can't/MD* think/VB of/IN anyone/PN ,/, Pete/NP ./.

A/AT faint/JJ crease/NN appeared/VBD between/IN the/AT man's/NN$ eyebrows/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PPSS think/VB you/PPSS aren't/BER* taking/VBG me/PPO seriously/RB ,/, Phil/NP ./.

Phil/NP rubbed/VBD his/PP$ forehead/NN wearily/RB ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ beginning/VBG to/TO feel/VB woolly/JJ ./.

Maybe/RB it/PPS would/MD be/BE better/JJR to/TO humor/VB the/AT guy/NN and/CC then/RB make/VB an/AT exit/NN ./.

He/PPS really/RB didn't/DOD* expect/VB anything/PN to/TO come/VB of/IN it/PPO ,/, and/CC there/EX were/BED a/AT few/AP people/NNS

``/`` All/QL right/RB ''/'' ,/, he/PPS conceded/VBD finally/RB ,/, ``/`` if/CS you/PPSS must/MD know/VB ,/, I/PPSS don't/DO* get/VB along/RB with/IN the/AT landlord/NN ./.

The/AT man/NN closed/VBD his/PP$ eyes/NNS and/CC nodded/VBD ./.

In/IN that/DT way/NN there's/EX+BEZ no/AT trouble/NN for/IN the/AT customer/NN ''/'' ./.

``/`` It's/PPS+BEZ my/PP$ line/NN of/IN work/NN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD

Five/CD minutes/NNS later/RBR ,/, before/CS Haney/NP could/MD make/VB his/PP$ break/NN ,/, the/AT stranger/NN stood/VBD up/RP and/CC nodded/VBD farewell/NN ./.

Haney/NP watched/VBD the/AT small/JJ but/CC wiry/JJ man/NN slip/VB out/IN the/AT door/NN quickly/RB and/CC silently/RB ,/, and/CC felt/VBD relieved/VBN to/TO see/VB that/CS nobody/PN else/RB seemed/VBD to/TO notice/VB his/PP$ departure/NN ./.

His/PP$ spine/NN crawled/VBD with/IN a/AT foreboding/VBG premonition/NN as/CS he/PPS asked/VBD one/CD of/IN his/PP$ fellow/NN tenants/NNS what/WDT had/HVD happened/VBN ./.

The/AT landlord/NN had/HVD died/VBN ./.

Late/RB that/DT afternoon/NN ,/, it/PPS seemed/VBD ,/, he/PPS had/HVD fallen/VBN off/IN the/AT roof/NN while/CS on/IN some/DTI obscure/JJ errand/NN or/CC inspection/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD apparently/RB been/BEN alone/RB ./.

Nobody/PN witnessed/VBD the/AT fall/NN --/-- just/RB the/AT sickening/VBG impact/NN when/WRB his/PP$ body/NN smashed/VBD on/IN the/AT pavement/NN just/RB outside/IN the/AT basement/NN delivery/NN entrance/NN ./.

Haney/NP hoped/VBD that/CS nobody/PN noticed/VBD his/PP$ sudden/JJ pallor/NN ,/, as/CS he/PPS felt/VBD the/AT blood/NN drain/NN from/IN his/PP$ cheeks/NNS ./.

He/PPS muttered/VBD something/PN about/IN how/WRB terrible/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, and/CC walked/VBD with/IN deliberate/JJ slowness/NN to/IN the/AT elevator/NN ./.

Once/RB inside/IN his/PP$ apartment/NN ,/, he/PPS poured/VBD a/AT drink/NN with/IN trembling/VBG hands/NNS and/CC flopped/VBD limply/RB in/IN a/AT chair/NN ./.

After/IN a/AT while/NN he/PPS began/VBD to/TO feel/VB better/RBR about/IN it/PPO ,/, especially/RB when/WRB no/AT one/PN bothered/VBD to/TO ask/VB any/DTI questions/NNS ./.

But/CC after/IN all/ABN ,/, why/WRB should/MD they/PPSS ?/. ?/.

Still/QL later/RBR ,/, he/PPS finally/RB convinced/VBD himself/PPL that/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ an/AT accident/NN --/-- just/RB a/AT coincidence/NN ./.

The/AT stranger/NN really/RB had/HVD nothing/PN to/TO do/DO with/IN it/PPO ,/, of/IN course/NN

Haney/NP went/VBD to/IN bed/NN ,/, happy/JJ that/CS at/IN least/AP he/PPS was/BEDZ rid/JJ of/IN that/DT lousy/JJ landlord/NN ./.

After/IN all/ABN ,/, the/AT man/NN had/HVD no/AT family/NN ,/, so/CS no/AT one/PN suffered/VBD ,/, and/CC everybody/PN was/BEDZ better/JJR off/RP for/IN it/PPO ./.

Really/RB ,/, he/PPS said/VBD to/IN himself/PPL ,/, nobody/PN kills/VBZ a/AT man/NN just/RB as/CS a/AT favor/NN !/. !/.

So/RB you/PPSS thought/VBD I/PPSS didn't/DOD* mean/VB what/WDT I/PPSS said/VBD ./.

The/AT stranger's/NN$ eyes/NNS were/BED large/JJ and/CC sad/JJ ,/, as/CS if/CS Phil/NP Haney/NP had/HVD hurt/NN his/PP$ feelings/NNS ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ like/CS a/AT recurrent/JJ ,/, annoying/JJ dream/NN ,/, but/CC now/RB the/AT dream/NN was/BEDZ beginning/VBG to/TO take/VB on/IN overtones/NNS of/IN a/AT nightmare/NN ./.

However/WRB ,/, Haney/NP knew/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ not/* a/AT dream/NN ./.

He/PPS might/MD be/BE very/QL tight/JJ ,/, but/CC he/PPS knew/VBD where/WRB he/PPS was/BEDZ ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT same/AP bar/NN ,/, and/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ two/CD weeks/NNS later/RBR --/-- Saturday/NR night/NN ,/, when/WRB he/PPS had/HVD an/AT excuse/NN to/TO drink/VB heavier/RBR than/CS usual/JJ ./.

He/PPS had/HVD been/BEN sitting/VBG in/IN the/AT usual/JJ corner/NN at/IN the/AT little/AP table/NN ,/, as/QL far/JJ as/CS possible/JJ from/IN any/DTI talkative/JJ ,/, friendly/JJ lushes/NNS ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ enjoying/VBG the/AT weekly/JJ ritual/NN of/IN washing/VBG down/RP his/PP$ pet/NN grievance/NN with/IN bourbon/NN slightly/RB moistened/VBN with/IN water/NN ./.

This/DT favorite/NN grievance/NN was/BEDZ not/* the/AT landlord/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD already/RB quite/QL forgotten/VBN about/IN him/PPO ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD only/RB mentioned/VBN him/PPO on/IN the/AT spur/NN of/IN the/AT moment/NN ./.

His/PP$ real/JJ grievance/NN was/BEDZ Lolly/NP ./.

Toward/IN the/AT end/NN of/IN his/PP$ fourth/OD hairy/JJ highball/NN ,/, while/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ moodily/RB making/VBG wet/JJ rings/NNS on/IN the/AT table-top/NN with/IN the/AT bottom/NN of/IN the/AT glass/NN ,/, he/PPS became/VBD aware/JJ that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ not/* alone/RB ./.

He/PPS looked/VBD up/RP with/IN bloodshot/JJ eyes/NNS and/CC beheld/VBD the/AT stranger/NN sitting/VBG across/IN the/AT table/NN ,/, smiling/VBG a/AT secret/JJ smile/NN at/IN him/PPO ,/, as/CS if/CS they/PPSS were/BED fellow/NN conspirators/NNS ./.

He/PPS hadn't/HVD* even/RB noticed/VBN --/-- what/WDT was/BEDZ his/PP$ name/NN ?/. ?/.

Pete/NP ?/. ?/.

--/-- he/PPS hadn't/HVD* seen/VBN him/PPO sit/VB down/RP ./.

The/AT man/NN was/BEDZ uncanny/JJ ,/, like/CS a/AT shadow/NN ,/, and/CC made/VBD as/QL much/AP noise/NN as/CS a/AT shadow/NN ./.

Haney/NP felt/VBD like/CS shrinking/VBG out/RP of/IN sight/NN ,/, but/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ already/RB trapped/VBN in/IN the/AT corner/NN with/IN the/AT wiry/JJ ,/, dark/JJ little/AP man/NN ./.

He/PPS began/VBD to/TO wish/VB that/CS he/PPS hadn't/HVD* shouted/VBN that/DT other/AP evening/NN when/WRB the/AT truck/NN bore/VBD down/RP through/IN the/AT crossing/NN ./.

Was/BEDZ he/PPS going/VBG to/TO be/BE saddled/VBN from/IN now/RB on/RP with/IN a/AT creep/NN for/IN a/AT bar-buddy/NN ?/. ?/.

He'd/PPS+MD have/HV to/TO start/VB going/VBG to/IN some/DTI of/IN the/AT other/AP places/NNS again/RB ./.

In/IN a/AT low/JJ voice/NN ,/, almost/RB whispering/VBG ,/, the/AT man/NN had/HVD asked/VBN Phil/NP if/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ happy/JJ with/IN the/AT way/NN the/AT landlord/NN had/HVD been/BEN taken/VBN off/IN his/PP$ back/NN ./.

He/PPS made/VBD the/AT mistake/NN of/IN answering/VBG in/IN an/AT offhand/JJ way/NN ,/, and/CC instantly/RB realized/VBD that/CS his/PP$ skepticism/NN must/MD have/HV showed/VBN in/IN his/PP$ face/NN or/CC voice/NN ./.

Pete/NP frowned/VBD slightly/RB ,/, then/RB became/VBD sad/JJ and/CC moody/JJ ./.

Haney/NP didn't/DOD* want/VB to/TO encourage/VB his/PP$ company/NN ,/, but/CC felt/VBD he/PPS ought/MD to/TO buy/VB him/PPO a/AT drink/NN anyhow/RB ,/, to/TO prevent/VB possible/JJ trouble/NN ./.

But/CC there/EX was/BEDZ no/AT trouble/NN ./.

The/AT guy/NN sulked/VBD over/IN his/PP$ drink/NN ,/, obviously/RB upset/VBN by/IN Haney's/NP$ lack/NN of/IN appreciation/NN ./.

To/TO break/VB the/AT uncomfortable/JJ silence/NN ,/, Haney/NP began/VBD to/TO talk/VB ./.

In/IN time/NN ,/, and/CC two/CD drinks/NNS later/RBR ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ complaining/VBG bitterly/RB about/IN his/PP$ wife/NN ,/, He/PPS was/BEDZ on/IN the/AT subject/NN for/IN ten/CD minutes/NNS or/CC so/RB when/WRB he/PPS noticed/VBD the/AT renewed/VBN interest/NN in/IN his/PP$ listener/NN --/-- it/PPS showed/VBD in/IN the/AT alert/JJ face/NN and/CC the/AT suddenly/RB bright/JJ eyes/NNS ./.

When/WRB he/PPS paused/VBD to/TO moisten/VB his/PP$ throat/NN ,/, the/AT stranger/NN broke/VBD in/RP ./.

``/`` But/CC why/WRB pay/NN her/PP$ bills/NNS ?/. ?/.

If/CS she/PPS runs/VBZ around/RB with/IN other/AP men/NNS ,/, and/CC if/CS you/PPSS hate/VB her/PPO as/CS you/PPSS say/VB ,/, why/WRB not/* just/RB divorce/VB her/PPO ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Haney/NP scowled/VBD ./.

``/`` That/DT bitch/NN would/MD love/VB a/AT divorce/NN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS growled/VBD ./.

``/`` Then/RB she'd/PPS+MD get/VB half/ABN of/IN everything/PN I/PPSS have/HV ./.

``/`` Oh/UH yes/RB ./.

You/PPSS must/MD understand/VB ,/, I/PPSS haven't/HV* been/BEN in/IN this/DT state/NN too/QL long/JJ ./.

You/PPSS should/MD have/HV told/VBN me/PPO about/IN her/PPO before/RB ''/'' ./.

Haney/NP felt/VBD a/AT twinge/NN of/IN annoyance/NN when/WRB he/PPS heard/VBD the/AT now/RB familiar/JJ line/NN again/RB ./.

Then/RB a/AT wild/JJ thought/NN ran/VBD circles/NNS through/IN his/PP$ clouded/VBN brain/NN ./.

Suppose/VB --/-- just/RB suppose/VB this/DT guy/NN was/BEDZ really/RB what/WDT he/PPS said/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ !/. !/.

A/AT retired/VBN professional/JJ killer/NN If/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ just/RB a/AT nut/NN ,/, no/AT harm/NN was/BEDZ done/VBN ./.

But/CC if/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT real/JJ thing/NN ,/, he/PPS could/MD do/DO something/PN about/IN Lolly/NP ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD very/QL cunning/JJ ,/, very/QL proud/JJ of/IN himself/PPL as/CS he/PPS played/VBD on/IN the/AT other/AP man's/NN$ soft/JJ spot/NN ./.

``/`` No/AT offense/NN intended/VBN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD gently/RB ./.

``/`` But/CC it's/PPS+BEZ just/RB that/CS --/-- well/UH ,/, you/PPSS know/VB ./.

He/PPS shrugged/VBD casually/RB ./.

``/`` But/CC if/CS you/PPSS say/VB you/PPSS managed/VBD it/PPO ''/'' The/AT stranger/NN was/BEDZ hooked/VBN ./.

His/PP$ eyes/NNS burned/VBD feverishly/RB ./.

``/`` Yes/RB ,/, yes/RB ''/'' ,/, he/PPS muttered/VBD impatiently/RB ./.

``/`` Of/IN course/NN it/PPS looked/VBD like/CS an/AT accident/NN ./.

He/PPS waited/VBD eagerly/RB ./.

Haney/NP swished/VBD the/AT liquor/NN in/IN the/AT bottom/NN of/IN his/PP$ glass/NN ./.

About/RB halfway/RB back/RB Pops/NP groped/VBD against/IN a/AT wall/NN and/CC stopped/VBD ,/, pulled/VBD away/RB two/CD loosely/RB nailed/VBN wide/JJ boards/NNS at/IN one/CD end/NN ,/, and/CC went/VBD through/RP ./.

I/PPSS jist/RB stayed/VBD where/WRB I/PPSS was/BEDZ while/CS he/PPS fumbled/VBD around/RB and/CC then/RB walked/VBD away/RB ./.

``/`` I've/PPSS+HV been/BEN careful/JJ about/IN fingerprints/NNS ./.

``/`` Same/AP ./.

Let's/VB+PPO do/DO that/DT ''/'' ./.

We/PPSS did/DOD that/DT and/CC found/VBD a/AT dirty/JJ handkerchief/NN ,/, some/DTI matches/NNS and/CC fourteen/CD cents/NNS in/IN change/NN ./.

We/PPSS took/VBD the/AT matches/NNS --/-- they/PPSS were/BED book/NN matches/NNS and/CC once/RB they'd/PPSS+HVD been/BEN touched/VBN might/MD retain/VB fingerprints/NNS --/-- and/CC the/AT change/NN ./.

We/PPSS discussed/VBD the/AT candle/NN and/CC decided/VBD the/AT hypothetical/JJ other/AP bum/NN would/MD have/HV left/VBN it/PPO burning/VBG to/TO light/VB his/PP$ way/NN to/IN the/AT window/NN and/CC because/CS he'd/PPS+MD have/HV no/AT reason/NN to/TO blow/VB it/PPO out/RP ./.

The/AT candle/NN had/HVD been/BEN stuck/VBN on/IN a/AT tin/NN lid/NN so/CS it/PPS wouldn't/MD* set/VB fire/NN to/IN the/AT crate/NN when/WRB it/PPS guttered/VBD out/RP ./.

We/PPSS went/VBD once/RB more/RBR over/IN every/AT point/NN ,/, then/RB triple-checked/JJ ./.

Being/BEG picked/VBN up/RP for/IN questioning/VBG by/IN a/AT cop/NN on/IN the/AT way/NN out/RP seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE the/AT only/RB possible/JJ remaining/VBG danger/NN ,/, and/CC we/PPSS weren't/BED* picked/VBN up/RP by/IN a/AT cop/NN ./.

We/PPSS planned/VBD ahead/RB only/RB one/CD step/NN ,/, a/AT rendezvous/NN for/IN tomorrow/NR when/WRB we/PPSS could/MD swap/VB notes/NNS ./.

Charlie/NP had/HVD brought/VBN food/NN and/CC we'd/PPSS+HVD decided/VBN on/IN no/AT drinks/NNS ./.

the/AT Gabriel/NP pointed/VBD towards/IN her/PPO destination/NN and/CC ,/, under/IN one-gee/JJ acceleration/NN ,/, began/VBD to/TO build/VB up/RP towards/IN her/PP$ ultimate/JJ velocity/NN ,/, 99.1/CD percent/NN of/IN the/AT speed/NN of/IN light/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, all/ABN the/AT personnel/NNS except/IN those/DTS few/AP needed/VBN to/TO carry/VB out/RP the/AT performance/NN of/IN the/AT ship/NN ,/, went/VBD into/IN the/AT suspensor/NN ./.

Many/AP years/NNS later/RBR ,/, the/AT photon-counting/JJ apparatus/NN in/IN the/AT nose/NN of/IN the/AT ship/NN would/MD determine/VB that/CS the/AT star/NN was/BEDZ close/JJ enough/QLP to/TO actuate/VB deceleration/NN ./.

Again/RB ,/, a/AT force/NN too/QL strong/JJ for/IN unfrozen/VBN bodies/NNS to/TO endure/VB would/MD be/BE applied/VBN ./.

Then/RB ,/, after/CS slowing/VBG the/AT vessel/NN considerably/RB ,/, the/AT drive/NN would/MD adjust/VB to/IN a/AT one-gee/JJ deceleration/NN ./.

And/CC the/AT crew/NN would/MD be/BE automatically/RB brought/VBN out/IN of/IN their/PP$ suspended/VBN animation/NN ./.

These/DTS members/NNS would/MD then/RB unthaw/VB the/AT rest/NN of/IN the/AT personnel/NNS ./.

And/CC ,/, in/IN the/AT half-year/NN left/VBN before/CS reaching/VBG their/PP$ destination/NN ,/, the/AT men/NNS would/MD carry/VB out/RP whatever/WDT preparations/NNS were/BED needed/VBN ./.

Hal/NP Yarrow/NP was/BEDZ among/IN the/AT last/AP to/TO go/VB into/IN the/AT suspensor/NN and/CC among/IN the/AT first/OD to/TO come/VB out/RP ./.

He/PPS had/HVD to/TO study/VB the/AT recordings/NNS of/IN the/AT language/NN of/IN the/AT chief/NN nation/NN of/IN Ozagen/NP ,/, Siddo/NP ./.

And/CC ,/, from/IN the/AT first/RB ,/, he/PPS faced/VBD a/AT difficult/JJ task/NN ./.

The/AT expedition/NN that/WPS had/HVD discovered/VBN Ozagen/NP had/HVD succeeded/VBN in/IN correlating/VBG two/CD thousand/CD Siddo/NP words/NNS with/IN an/AT equal/JJ number/NN of/IN American/JJ words/NNS ./.

The/AT description/NN of/IN the/AT Siddo/NP syntax/NN was/BEDZ very/QL restricted/VBN ./.

And/CC ,/, as/CS Hal/NP found/VBD out/RP ,/, obviously/RB mistaken/VBN in/IN many/AP cases/NNS ./.

This/DT discovery/NN caused/VBD Hal/NP anxiety/NN ./.

His/PP$ duty/NN was/BEDZ to/TO write/VB a/AT school/NN text/NN and/CC to/TO teach/VB the/AT entire/JJ personnel/NNS of/IN the/AT Gabriel/NP how/WRB to/TO speak/VB Ozagen/NP ./.

Yet/RB ,/, if/CS he/PPS used/VBD all/ABN of/IN the/AT little/AP means/NNS at/IN his/PP$ disposal/NN ,/, he/PPS would/MD be/BE instructing/VBG his/PP$ students/NNS wrongly/RB ./.

Moreover/RB ,/, even/RB getting/VBG this/DT across/RB would/MD be/BE difficult/JJ ./.

For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, the/AT organs/NNS of/IN speech/NN of/IN the/AT Ozagen/NP natives/NNS differed/VBD somewhat/RB from/IN Earthmen's/NPS$ ;/. ;/.

the/AT sounds/NNS made/VBN by/IN these/DTS organs/NNS were/BED ,/, therefore/RB ,/, dissimilar/JJ ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ true/JJ that/CS they/PPSS could/MD be/BE approximated/VBN ,/, but/CC would/MD the/AT Ozagenians/NPS understand/VB these/DTS approximations/NNS ?/. ?/.

Another/DT obstacle/NN was/BEDZ the/AT grammatical/JJ construction/NN of/IN Siddo/NP ./.

Consider/VB the/AT tense/NN system/NN ./.

Instead/RB of/IN inflecting/VBG a/AT verb/NN or/CC using/VBG an/AT unattached/JJ particle/NN to/TO indicate/VB the/AT past/NN or/CC future/NN ,/, Siddo/NP used/VBD an/AT entirely/RB different/JJ word/NN ./.

Thus/RB ,/, the/AT masculine/JJ animate/JJ infinitive/NN dabhumaksanigalu'ahai/VB ,/, meaning/VBG to/TO live/VB ,/, was/BEDZ ,/, in/IN the/AT perfect/JJ tense/NN ,/, ksu'u'peli'afo/VB ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN the/AT future/NN ,/, mai'teipa/NN ./.

The/AT same/AP use/NN of/IN an/AT entirely/RB different/JJ word/NN applied/VBD for/IN all/ABN the/AT other/AP tenses/NNS ./.

Plus/IN the/AT fact/NN that/CS Siddo/NP not/* only/RB had/HVD the/AT normal/JJ (/( to/IN Earthmen/NPS )/) three/CD genders/NNS of/IN masculine/JJ ,/, feminine/JJ ,/, and/CC neuter/JJ ,/, but/CC the/AT two/CD extra/JJ of/IN inanimate/JJ and/CC spiritual/JJ ./.

Fortunately/RB ,/, gender/NN was/BEDZ inflected/VBN ,/, though/CS the/AT expression/NN of/IN it/PPO would/MD be/BE difficult/JJ for/IN anybody/PN not/* born/VBN in/IN Siddo/NP ./.

The/AT system/NN of/IN indicating/VBG gender/NN varied/VBD according/RB to/IN tense/NN ./.

All/QL the/AT other/AP parts/NNS of/IN speech/NN :/: nouns/NNS ,/, pronouns/NNS ,/, adjectives/NNS ,/, adverbs/NNS ,/, and/CC conjunctions/NNS operated/VBD under/IN the/AT same/AP system/NN as/CS the/AT verbs/NNS ./.

This/DT was/BEDZ not/* ,/, for/IN the/AT Angel/NN ,/, just/RB a/AT matter/NN of/IN running/VBG through/IN a/AT logical/JJ or/CC deductive/JJ chain/NN ,/, or/CC deciding/VBG on/RP some/DTI action/NN from/IN some/DTI already/RB established/VBN premise/NN ./.

No/AT doubt/NN the/AT Angels/NNS could/MD do/DO that/DT kind/NN of/IN thing/NN as/QL fast/JJ as/CS any/DTI computer/NN ./.

What/WDT Gabriel/NP was/BEDZ being/BEG asked/VBN to/TO do/DO now/RB ,/, however/WRB ,/, was/BEDZ to/TO re-examine/VB all/ABN his/PP$ basic/JJ assumptions/NNS ,/, make/VB value-judgments/NNS on/IN them/PPO ,/, and/CC give/VB them/PPO new/JJ and/CC different/JJ powers/NNS in/IN his/PP$ mind/NN to/TO govern/VB his/PP$ motives/NNS ./.

This/DT is/BEZ not/* wholly/RB a/AT reasoning/VBG process/NN --/-- a/AT computer/NN cannot/MD* do/DO it/PPO all/ABN --/-- and/CC even/RB in/IN an/AT Angel/NN it/PPS takes/VBZ time/NN ./.

The/AT good/JJ man/NN chortled/VBD appreciatively/RB and/CC decided/VBD the/AT trip/NN was/BEDZ worth/JJ his/PP$ time/NN ./.

If/CS the/AT investigation/NN committee/NN spent/VBD months/NNS digesting/VBG the/AT thoughtful/JJ food/NN served/VBN them/PPO at/IN the/AT Laboratory/NN School/NN ,/, they/PPSS left/VBD Helva/NP with/IN a/AT morsel/NN as/QL well/RB ./.

``/`` Singing/VBG ''/'' as/QL applicable/JJ to/IN herself/PPL required/VBD research/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, been/BEN exposed/VBN to/IN and/CC enjoyed/VBD a/AT music/NN appreciation/NN course/NN which/WDT had/HVD included/VBN the/AT better/RBR known/VBN classical/JJ works/NNS such/JJ as/CS ``/`` Tristan/NP und/CC Isolde/NP ''/'' ,/, ``/`` Candide/NP ''/'' ,/, ``/`` Oklahoma/NP ''/'' ,/, ``/`` Nozze/NNS de/IN Figaro/NP ''/'' ,/, the/AT atomic/JJ age/NN singers/NNS ,/, Eileen/NP Farrell/NP ,/, Elvis/NP Presley/NP and/CC Geraldine/NP Todd/NP ,/, as/QL well/RB as/CS the/AT curious/JJ rhythmic/JJ progressions/NNS of/IN the/AT Venusians/NPS ,/, Capellan/JJ visual/JJ chromatics/NNS and/CC the/AT sonic/JJ concerti/NNS of/IN the/AT Altairians/NPS ./.

But/CC ``/`` singing/VBG ''/'' for/IN any/DTI shell/NN person/NN posed/VBD considerable/JJ technical/JJ difficulties/NNS to/TO be/BE overcome/VBN ./.

Shell/NN people/NNS were/BED schooled/VBN to/TO examine/VB every/AT aspect/NN of/IN a/AT problem/NN or/CC situation/NN before/CS making/VBG a/AT prognosis/NN ./.

Balanced/VBN properly/RB between/IN optimism/NN and/CC practicality/NN ,/, the/AT nondefeatist/NN attitude/NN of/IN the/AT shell/NN people/NNS led/VBD them/PPO to/TO extricate/VB themselves/PPLS ,/, their/PP$ ships/NNS and/CC personnel/NNS ,/, from/IN bizarre/JJ situations/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB to/IN Helva/NP ,/, the/AT problem/NN that/CS she/PPS couldn't/MD* open/VB her/PP$ mouth/NN to/TO sing/VB ,/, among/IN other/AP restrictions/NNS ,/, did/DOD not/* bother/VB her/PPO ./.

She/PPS would/MD work/VB out/RP a/AT method/NN ,/, by-passing/JJ her/PP$ limitations/NNS ,/, whereby/WRB she/PPS could/MD sing/VB ./.

She/PPS approached/VBD the/AT problem/NN by/IN investigating/VBG the/AT methods/NNS of/IN sound/NN reproduction/NN through/IN the/AT centuries/NNS ,/, human/NN and/CC instrumental/JJ ./.

Her/PP$ own/JJ sound/NN production/NN equipment/NN was/BEDZ essentially/RB more/QL instrumental/JJ than/CS vocal/JJ ./.

Breath/NN control/NN and/CC the/AT proper/JJ enunciation/NN of/IN vowel/NN sounds/NNS within/IN the/AT oral/JJ cavity/NN appeared/VBD to/TO require/VB the/AT most/AP development/NN and/CC practice/NN ./.

Shell/NN people/NNS did/DOD not/* ,/, strictly/RB speaking/VBG ,/, breathe/VB ./.

For/IN their/PP$ purposes/NNS ,/, oxygen/NN and/CC other/AP gases/NNS were/BED not/* drawn/VBN from/IN the/AT surrounding/VBG atmosphere/NN through/IN the/AT medium/NN of/IN lungs/NNS but/CC sustained/VBN artificially/RB by/IN solution/NN in/IN their/PP$ shells/NNS ./.

After/IN experimentation/NN ,/, Helva/NP discovered/VBD that/CS she/PPS could/MD manipulate/VB her/PP$ diaphragmic/JJ unit/NN to/TO sustain/VB tone/NN ./.

By/IN relaxing/VBG the/AT throat/NN muscles/NNS and/CC expanding/VBG the/AT oral/JJ cavity/NN well/RB into/IN the/AT frontal/JJ sinuses/NNS ,/, she/PPS could/MD direct/VB the/AT vowel/NN sounds/NNS into/IN the/AT most/QL felicitous/JJ position/NN for/IN proper/JJ reproduction/NN through/IN her/PP$ throat/NN microphone/NN ./.

She/PPS compared/VBD the/AT results/NNS with/IN tape/NN recordings/NNS of/IN modern/JJ singers/NNS and/CC was/BEDZ not/* unpleased/JJ although/CS her/PP$ own/JJ tapes/NNS had/HVD a/AT peculiar/JJ quality/NN about/IN them/PPO ,/, not/* at/IN all/QL unharmonious/JJ ,/, merely/RB unique/JJ ./.

Acquiring/VBG a/AT repertoire/NN from/IN the/AT Laboratory/NN library/NN was/BEDZ no/AT problem/NN to/IN one/PN trained/VBN to/IN perfect/JJ recall/NN ./.

She/PPS found/VBD herself/PPL able/JJ to/TO sing/VB any/DTI role/NN and/CC any/DTI song/NN which/WDT struck/VBD her/PPO fancy/NN ./.

It/PPS would/MD not/* have/HV occurred/VBN to/IN her/PPO that/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ curious/JJ for/IN a/AT female/NN to/TO sing/VB bass/NN ,/, baritone/NN ,/, tenor/NN ,/, alto/NN ,/, mezzo/NN ,/, soprano/NN and/CC coloratura/NN as/CS she/PPS pleased/VBD ./.

If/CS the/AT authorities/NNS remarked/VBD on/IN her/PP$ curious/JJ avocation/NN ,/, they/PPSS did/DOD so/RB among/IN themselves/PPLS ./.

Shell/NN people/NNS were/BED encouraged/VBN to/TO develop/VB a/AT hobby/NN so/QL long/JJ as/CS they/PPSS maintained/VBD proficiency/NN in/IN their/PP$ technical/JJ work/NN ./.

On/IN the/AT anniversary/NN of/IN her/PPO sixteenth/OD year/NN in/IN her/PP$ shell/NN ,/, Helva/NP was/BEDZ unconditionally/RB graduated/VBN and/CC installed/VBN in/IN her/PP$ ship/NN ,/, the/AT Aj/NP ./.

The/AT neural/JJ ,/, audio/JJ ,/, visual/JJ and/CC sensory/JJ connections/NNS were/BED made/VBN and/CC sealed/VBN ./.

When/WRB she/PPS awoke/VBD ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT ship/NN ./.

Her/PP$ brain/NN and/CC intelligence/NN controlled/VBD every/AT function/NN from/IN navigation/NN to/IN such/JJ loading/VBG as/CS a/AT scout/NN ship/NN of/IN her/PP$ class/NN needed/VBD ./.

She/PPS could/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN herself/PPL and/CC her/PP$ ambulatory/JJ half/ABN ,/, in/IN any/DTI situation/NN already/RB recorded/VBN in/IN the/AT annals/NNS of/IN Central/JJ Worlds/NNS and/CC any/DTI situation/NN its/PP$ most/QL fertile/JJ minds/NNS could/MD imagine/VB ./.

Her/PP$ first/RB actual/JJ flight/NN ,/, for/CS she/PPS and/CC her/PP$ kind/NN had/HVD made/VBN mock/JJ flights/NNS on/IN dummy/JJ panels/NNS since/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ eight/CD ,/, showed/VBD her/PP$ complete/JJ mastery/NN of/IN the/AT techniques/NNS of/IN her/PP$ profession/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ ready/JJ for/IN her/PP$ great/JJ adventures/NNS and/CC the/AT arrival/NN of/IN her/PPO mobile/JJ partner/NN ./.

There/EX were/BED nine/CD qualified/VBN scouts/NNS sitting/VBG around/RB collecting/VBG base/NN pay/NN the/AT day/NN Helva/NP was/BEDZ commissioned/VBN ./.

Consequently/RB no/AT one/PN had/HVD remembered/VBN to/TO introduce/VB Helva/NP to/IN the/AT prospective/JJ partners/NNS ./.

The/AT ship/NN always/RB chose/VBD its/PP$ own/JJ partner/NN ./.

As/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, while/CS Central/JJ wrangled/VBD among/IN itself/PPL ,/, Robert/NP Tanner/NP sneaked/VBD out/IN of/IN the/AT pilots'/NNS$ barracks/NN ,/, out/RP to/IN the/AT field/NN and/CC over/RP to/IN Helva's/NP$ slim/JJ metal/NN hull/NN ./.

Even/RB to/IN herself/PPL Helva/NP sounded/VBD a/AT little/QL self-pitying/JJ but/CC the/AT truth/NN was/BEDZ she/PPS was/BEDZ lonely/JJ ,/, sitting/VBG on/IN the/AT darkened/VBN field/NN ./.

The/AT half-man/NN received/VBD a/AT dromozootic/JJ implant/NN ,/, turned/VBD red/JJ in/IN the/AT face/NN ,/, shouted/VBD senselessly/RB at/IN Mercer/NP ,/, ``/`` Take/VB it/PPO out/RP ,/, you/PPSS fool/NN !/. !/.

Take/VB it/PPO out/IN of/IN me/PPO ''/'' !/. !/.

When/WRB Mercer/NP looked/VBD on/IN helplessly/RB ,/, the/AT half-man/NN twisted/VBD over/RP on/IN his/PP$ side/NN ,/, his/PP$ pink/JJ dusty/JJ back/NN turned/VBN to/IN Mercer/NP ,/, and/CC wept/VBD hoarsely/RB and/CC quietly/RB to/IN himself/PPL ./.

Mercer/NP himself/PPL could/MD not/* tell/VB how/WRB long/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ before/CS B'dikkat/NP came/VBD back/RB ./.

It/PPS might/MD have/HV been/BEN several/AP days/NNS ./.

It/PPS might/MD have/HV been/BEN several/AP months/NNS ./.

Once/RB again/RB B'dikkat/NP moved/VBD among/IN them/PPO like/CS a/AT father/NN ;/. ;/.

once/RB again/RB they/PPSS clustered/VBD like/CS children/NNS ./.

This/DT time/NN B'dikkat/NP smiled/VBD pleasantly/RB at/IN the/AT little/JJ head/NN which/WDT had/HVD grown/VBN out/IN of/IN Mercer's/NP$ thigh/NN --/-- a/AT sleeping/VBG child's/NN$ head/NN ,/, covered/VBN with/IN light/NN hair/NN on/IN top/NN and/CC with/IN dainty/JJ eyebrows/NNS over/IN the/AT resting/VBG eyes/NNS ./.

Mercer/NP got/VBD the/AT blissful/JJ needle/NN ./.

When/WRB B'dikkat/NP cut/VB the/AT head/NN from/IN Mercer's/NP$ thigh/NN ,/, he/PPS felt/VBD the/AT knife/NN grinding/VBG against/IN the/AT cartilage/NN which/WDT held/VBD the/AT head/NN to/IN his/PP$ own/JJ body/NN ./.

He/PPS saw/VBD the/AT child-face/NN grimace/VB as/CS the/AT head/NN was/BEDZ cut/VBN ;/. ;/.

he/PPS felt/VBD the/AT far/JJ ,/, cool/JJ flash/NN of/IN unimportant/JJ pain/NN ,/, as/CS B'dikkat/NP dabbed/VBD the/AT wound/NN with/IN a/AT corrosive/JJ antiseptic/NN which/WDT stopped/VBD all/ABN bleeding/NN immediately/RB ./.

The/AT next/AP time/NN it/PPS was/BEDZ two/CD legs/NNS growing/VBG from/IN his/PP$ chest/NN ./.

Then/RB there/EX had/HVD been/BEN another/DT head/NN beside/IN his/PP$ own/JJ ./.

Or/CC was/BEDZ that/CS after/IN the/AT torso/NN and/CC legs/NNS ,/, waist/NN to/IN toe-tips/NNS ,/, of/IN the/AT little/JJ girl/NN which/WDT had/HVD grown/VBN from/IN his/PP$ side/NN ?/. ?/.

He/PPS forgot/VBD the/AT order/NN ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* count/VB time/NN ./.

Lady/NN Da/NP smiled/VBD at/IN him/PPO often/RB ,/, but/CC there/EX was/BEDZ no/AT love/NN in/IN this/DT place/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD lost/VBN the/AT extra/JJ torsos/NNS ./.

In/IN between/IN teratologies/NNS ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT pretty/JJ and/CC shapely/JJ woman/NN ;/. ;/.

but/CC the/AT nicest/JJT thing/NN about/IN their/PP$ relationship/NN was/BEDZ her/PP$ whisper/NN to/IN him/PPO ,/, repeated/VBD some/DTI thousands/NNS of/IN time/NN ,/, repeated/VBD with/IN smiles/NNS and/CC hope/NN ,/, ``/`` People/NNS never/RB live/VB forever/RB ''/'' ./.

She/PPS found/VBD this/DT immensely/RB comforting/VBG ,/, even/RB though/CS Mercer/NP did/DOD not/* make/VB much/AP sense/NN out/IN of/IN it/PPO ./.

Thus/RB events/NNS occurred/VBD ,/, and/CC victims/NNS changed/VBD in/IN appearance/NN ,/, and/CC new/JJ ones/NNS arrived/VBD ./.

Sometimes/RB B'dikkat/NP took/VBD the/AT new/JJ ones/NNS ,/, resting/VBG in/IN the/AT everlasting/JJ sleep/NN of/IN their/PP$ burned-out/JJ brains/NNS ,/, in/IN a/AT ground-truck/NN to/TO be/BE added/VBN to/IN other/AP herds/NNS ./.

The/AT bodies/NNS in/IN the/AT truck/NN threshed/VBD and/CC bawled/VBD without/IN human/NN speech/NN when/WRB the/AT dromozoa/NNS struck/VBD them/PPO ./.

Finally/RB ,/, Mercer/NP did/DOD manage/VB to/TO follow/VB B'dikkat/NP to/IN the/AT door/NN of/IN the/AT cabin/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD to/TO fight/VB the/AT bliss/NN of/IN super-condamine/NN to/TO do/DO it/PPO ./.

Only/RB the/AT memory/NN of/IN previous/JJ hurt/NN ,/, bewilderment/NN and/CC perplexity/NN made/VBD him/PPO sure/JJ that/CS if/CS he/PPS did/DOD not/* ask/VB B'dikkat/NP when/WRB he/PPS ,/, Mercer/NP ,/, was/BEDZ happy/JJ ,/, the/AT answer/NN would/MD no/AT longer/RBR be/BE available/JJ when/WRB he/PPS needed/VBD it/PPO ./.

Fighting/VBG pleasure/NN itself/PPL ,/, he/PPS begged/VBD B'dikkat/NP to/TO check/VB the/AT records/NNS and/CC to/TO tell/VB him/PPO how/WRB long/JJ he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN there/RB ./.

B'dikkat/NP grudgingly/RB agreed/VBD ,/, but/CC he/PPS did/DOD not/* come/VB out/IN of/IN the/AT doorway/NN ./.

He/PPS spoke/VBD through/IN the/AT public/JJ address/NN box/NN built/VBD into/IN the/AT cabin/NN ,/, and/CC his/PP$ gigantic/JJ voice/NN roared/VBD out/RP over/IN the/AT empty/JJ plain/NN ,/, so/CS that/CS the/AT pink/JJ herd/NN of/IN talking/VBG people/NNS stirred/VBD gently/RB in/IN their/PP$ happiness/NN and/CC wondered/VBD what/WDT their/PP$ friend/NN B'dikkat/NP might/MD be/BE wanting/VBG to/TO tell/VB them/PPO ./.

When/WRB he/PPS said/VBD it/PPO ,/, they/PPSS thought/VBD it/PPO exceedingly/RB profound/JJ ,/, though/CS none/PN of/IN them/PPO understood/VBN it/PPO ,/, since/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ simply/RB the/AT amount/VB of/IN time/NN that/CS Mercer/NP had/HVD been/BEN on/IN Shayol/NP :/:

Mercer/NP turned/VBD away/RB ./.

The/AT secret/NN little/AP corner/NN of/IN his/PP$ mind/NN ,/, which/WDT stayed/VBD sane/JJ through/IN happiness/NN and/CC pain/NN ,/, made/VBD him/PPO wonder/VB about/IN B'dikkat/NP ./.

Mercer/NP ,/, despite/IN his/PP$ happiness/NN ,/, wept/VBD a/AT little/AP at/IN the/AT strange/JJ fate/NN of/IN B'dikkat/NP ./.

His/PP$ own/JJ fate/NN he/PPS accepted/VBD ./.

He/PPS remembered/VBD the/AT last/AP time/NN he/PPS had/HVD eaten/VBN --/-- actual/JJ eggs/NNS from/IN an/AT actual/JJ pan/NN ./.

The/AT dromozoa/NNS kept/VBD him/PPO alive/JJ ,/, but/CC he/PPS did/DOD not/* know/VB how/WRB they/PPSS did/DOD it/PPO ./.

Though/CS they/PPSS saw/VBD the/AT old-style/NN chemical/NN rockets/NNS lift/VB up/RP from/IN the/AT field/NN beyond/IN B'dikkat's/NP$ cabin/NN ,/, they/PPSS did/DOD not/* make/VB plans/NNS to/TO hide/VB among/IN the/AT frozen/VBN crop/NN of/IN transmuted/VBN flesh/NN ./.

The/AT best/JJT antidote/NN for/IN the/AT bitterness/NN and/CC disappointment/NN that/WPS poisoned/VBD him/PPO was/BEDZ hard/JJ work/NN ./.

He/PPS found/VBD that/CS if/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ tired/VBN enough/QLP at/IN night/NN ,/, he/PPS went/VBD to/IN sleep/NN simply/RB because/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ too/QL exhausted/VBN to/TO stay/VB awake/RB ./.

Because/CS the/AT summer/NN was/BEDZ unusually/RB dry/JJ and/CC hot/JJ ,/, the/AT spring/NN produced/VBD a/AT smaller/JJR stream/NN than/CS in/IN ordinary/JJ years/NNS ./.

The/AT grass/NN in/IN the/AT meadows/NNS came/VBD fast/RB ,/, now/RB that/CS the/AT warm/JJ weather/NN was/BEDZ here/RB ./.

He/PPS had/HVD no/AT idea/NN how/WRB much/AP time/NN Budd/NP would/MD give/VB him/PPO ./.

In/IN any/DTI case/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD no/AT intention/NN of/IN being/BEG caught/VBN asleep/RB ,/, so/CS he/PPS carried/VBD his/PP$ revolver/NN in/IN its/PP$ holster/NN on/IN his/PP$ hip/NN and/CC he/PPS took/VBD his/PP$ Winchester/NP with/IN him/PPO and/CC leaned/VBD it/PPO against/IN the/AT fence/NN ./.

He/PPS cleaned/VBD his/PP$ shovel/NN ,/, left/VBD it/PPO against/IN the/AT fence/NN ,/, picked/VBD up/IN his/PP$ Winchester/NP ,/, and/CC started/VBD downstream/RB ./.

His/PP$ visitors/NNS had/HVD crawled/VBN through/IN the/AT south/NR fence/NN and/CC were/BED crossing/VBG the/AT meadow/NN ,/, angling/VBG toward/IN the/AT house/NN ./.

The/AT boy/NN came/VBD on/IN to/IN the/AT porch/NN and/CC sat/VBD down/RP ,/, his/PP$ gaze/NN on/IN Morgan/NP as/CS if/CS half/ABN expecting/VBG him/PPO to/TO shoot/VB and/CC not/* really/RB caring/VBG ./.

Morgan/NP hesitated/VBD ,/, thinking/VBG that/CS if/CS this/DT was/BEDZ a/AT trick/NN ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT good/JJ one/CD ./.

He/PPS didn't/DOD* think/VB it/PPS was/BEDZ possible/JJ for/IN this/DT couple/NN to/TO be/BE pretending/VBG ./.

Morgan/NP jerked/VBD his/PP$ head/NN toward/IN the/AT front/JJ door/NN ./.

Any/DTI lingering/VBG suspicion/NN that/CS this/DT was/BEDZ a/AT trick/NN Al/NP Budd/NP had/HVD thought/VBN up/RP was/BEDZ dispelled/VBN ./.

No/AT girl/NN would/MD go/VB this/DT far/RB to/TO fool/VB a/AT man/NN so/CS she/PPS could/MD kill/VB him/PPO ./.

Besides/RB ,/, she/PPS had/HVD a/AT sweet/JJ face/NN that/WPS attracted/VBD him/PPO ./.

In/IN that/QL inert/JJ landscape/NN the/AT caravan/NN of/IN his/PP$ desires/NNS passed/VBD before/IN his/PP$ mind/NN ./.

In/IN vain/JJ his/PP$ mind/NN groped/VBD to/TO reassemble/VB the/AT bones/NNS of/IN the/AT relationships/NNS he/PPS had/HVD sought/VBN so/QL desperately/RB ,/, but/CC they/PPSS would/MD not/* come/VB to/IN life/NN ./.

The/AT silence/NN oppressed/VBD him/PPO ,/, made/VBD him/PPO bend/VB low/RB over/IN the/AT horse's/NN$ neck/NN as/CS if/CS to/TO hide/VB from/IN a/AT wind/NN that/WPS had/HVD begun/VBN to/TO blow/VB far/RB away/RB and/CC was/BEDZ twisting/VBG slowly/RB through/IN the/AT darkness/NN in/IN its/PP$ slow/JJ search/NN ./.

A/AT bold/JJ line/NN of/IN violet/NN broke/VBD loose/RB from/IN the/AT high/JJ ridge/NN of/IN the/AT mountains/NNS ,/, followed/VBD by/IN feathers/NNS of/IN red/NN that/WPS swept/VBD the/AT last/AP stars/NNS from/IN the/AT sky/NN ./.

The/AT wan/JJ light/NN spread/VBD over/IN the/AT ground/NN and/CC the/AT valley/NN revealed/VBD in/IN the/AT first/OD glimmer/NN the/AT contours/NNS of/IN trees/NNS and/CC fences/NNS and/CC palely/RB shadowed/VBN gullies/NNS ./.

The/AT stockade/NN was/BEDZ brilliantly/RB lighted/VBN and/CC the/AT guerrillas/NNS sighted/VBD him/PPO ./.

Montero's/NP$ rifle/NN cracked/VBD ./.

At/IN first/RB I/PPSS thought/VBD he/PPS had/HVD missed/VBN ./.

Gray/JJ Eyes/NNS remained/VBD erect/JJ ./.

The/AT feathered/VBN lance/NN was/BEDZ still/RB above/IN his/PP$ head/NN ./.

A/AT rifle/NN cracked/VBD ;/. ;/.

the/AT square/JJ head/NN fell/VB over/RP ./.

One/CD of/IN the/AT warriors/NNS suddenly/RB leaped/VBD to/IN his/PP$ feet/NNS and/CC began/VBD running/VBG across/IN the/AT valley/NN to/IN the/AT trees/NNS that/WPS lined/VBD the/AT small/JJ creek/NN ./.

The/AT sharp/JJ cries/NNS at/IN the/AT end/NN of/IN the/AT valley/NN were/BED faint/JJ ./.

I/PPSS forgot/VBD to/TO aim/VB ./.

The/AT horses/NNS were/BED only/RB several/AP lengths/NNS away/RB when/WRB he/PPS fired/VBD ./.

The/AT bullet/NN flung/VBD Gray/JJ Eyes/NNS from/IN his/PP$ horse/NN ./.

Oso/NP reached/VBD up/RP ,/, jerked/VBD the/AT buck/NN from/IN the/AT bale/NN and/CC snapped/VBD his/PP$ neck/NN ./.

Other/AP Indians/NPS were/BED running/VBG at/IN the/AT ponies/NNS ,/, shrilling/VBG and/CC waving/VBG blankets/NNS ./.

The/AT ponies/NNS were/BED almost/RB uncontrollable/JJ ./.

The/AT pall/NN of/IN dust/NN they/PPSS raised/VBD made/VBN it/PPO difficult/JJ to/TO see/VB when/WRB the/AT Aricaras/NPS charged/VBD again/RB ./.

This/DT time/NN more/AP of/IN them/PPO hurdled/VBN the/AT barrier/NN ./.

A/AT small/JJ Indian/NP dived/VBD at/IN Montero/NP ,/, who/WPS caught/VBD him/PPO with/IN a/AT swift/JJ upward/JJ stroke/NN of/IN his/PP$ rifle/NN butt/NN ./.

Although/CS my/PP$ shot/NN killed/VBD his/PP$ horse/NN ,/, he/PPS rolled/VBD off/IN the/AT bale/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN me/PPO ./.

A/AT warm/JJ breeze/NN played/VBD across/IN it/PPO ,/, moving/VBG it/PPO like/CS waves/NNS ./.

A/AT red-tailed/JJ hawk/NN flew/VBD in/RP behind/IN them/PPO and/CC stayed/VBD there/RB ,/, watching/VBG for/IN any/DTI snakes/NNS or/CC rabbits/NNS that/CS they/PPSS might/MD stir/VB up/RP from/IN the/AT side/NN of/IN the/AT road/NN ./.

It/PPS took/VBD them/PPO an/AT hour/NN before/CS they/PPSS came/VBD to/IN the/AT first/OD houses/NNS of/IN Kelseyville/NP ./.

Since/CS they/PPSS could/MD see/VB me/PPO but/CC I/PPSS not/* them/PPO ,/, their/PP$ presence/NN in/IN the/AT hall/NN disturbed/VBD me/PPO ./.

The/AT clerk/NN paid/VBD them/PPO no/AT attention/NN ./.

This/DT impressed/VBD me/PPO ,/, until/CS I/PPSS realized/VBD how/WRB limited/VBN was/BEDZ his/PP$ sphere/NN of/IN influence/NN ./.

His/PP$ job/NN simply/RB consisted/VBD in/IN registering/VBG new/JJ men/NNS ./.

When/WRB the/AT phone/NN rang/VBD he/PPS answered/VBD it/PPO ./.

His/PP$ authority/NN extended/VBD to/IN the/AT far/JJ edge/NN of/IN the/AT counter/NN ,/, no/AT further/RBR ./.

None/PN of/IN the/AT men/NNS hanging/VBG around/IN the/AT hall/NN bothered/VBD to/TO speak/VB to/IN him/PPO ./.

Baldness/NN was/BEDZ attacking/VBG his/PP$ pate/NN ./.

He/PPS spoke/VBD to/IN me/PPO in/IN a/AT gruff/JJ voice/NN ,/, an/AT affectation/NN which/WDT quite/RB belied/VBD his/PP$ personality/NN ./.

He/PPS wore/VBD his/PP$ white/JJ shirt/NN open/JJ at/IN the/AT neck/NN ,/, revealing/VBG a/AT bit/NN of/IN scrawny/JJ pale/JJ chest/NN underneath/RB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ obvious/JJ that/CS he/PPS wished/VBD himself/PPL different/JJ from/IN the/AT sort/NN of/IN person/NN he/PPS thought/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ ./.

But/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ not/* easy/JJ for/IN him/PPO and/CC he/PPS often/RB slipped/VBD ./.

When/WRB one/CD of/IN the/AT men/NNS in/IN the/AT hall/NN behind/IN us/PPO spat/VB on/IN the/AT floor/NN and/CC scraped/VBD his/PP$ boot/NN over/IN the/AT gob/NN of/IN spittle/NN I/PPSS noticed/VBD how/WRB the/AT clerk/NN winced/VBD ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD certain/JJ he/PPS was/BEDZ really/RB a/AT spineless/JJ little/JJ man/NN ./.

His/PP$ hat/NN (/( the/AT cause/NN of/IN his/PP$ baldness/NN ?/. ?/.

The/AT morning's/NN$ tabloids/NNS were/BED on/IN the/AT counter/NN ,/, and/CC a/AT stack/NN of/IN dog-eared/JJ men's/NNS$ magazines/NNS ./.

On/IN a/AT shelf/NN in/IN the/AT office/NN behind/IN the/AT counter/NN was/BEDZ a/AT small/JJ radio/NN dialed/VBN permanently/RB on/IN a/AT station/NN which/WDT broadcast/VBD only/AP vulgar/JJ commercials/NNS and/CC cheap/JJ popular/JJ music/NN ./.

Everything/PN about/IN the/AT clerk/NN was/BEDZ trivial/JJ ./.

Once/RB ,/, pressing/VBG him/PPO ,/, I/PPSS learned/VBD that/CS his/PP$ job/NN was/BEDZ only/RB part-time/JJ ,/, in/IN the/AT afternoons/NNS when/WRB nothing/PN went/VBD on/RP in/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

Noticing/VBG my/PP$ disappointment/NN he/PPS attempted/VBD to/TO salvage/VB what/WDT scraps/NNS and/CC shreds/NNS of/IN authority/NN he/PPS felt/VBD might/MD still/RB be/BE clinging/VBG to/IN his/PP$ person/NN ./.

With/IN distaste/NN I/PPSS saw/VBD him/PPO assume/VB a/AT pompous/JJ air/NN ./.

When/WRB he/PPS saw/VBD me/PPO coming/VBG he/PPS turned/VBD his/PP$ radio/NN off/RP ./.

He/PPS made/VBD a/AT show/NN of/IN rearranging/VBG my/PP$ forms/NNS on/IN the/AT shelf/NN ./.

He/PPS would/MD pick/VB up/RP the/AT ringing/VBG phone/NN with/IN studied/VBN negligence/NN ,/, then/RB bark/NN into/IN it/PPO with/IN gruff/JJ importance/NN ./.

What/WDT limited/VBD knowledge/NN he/PPS possessed/VBD he/PPS forced/VBD upon/IN me/PPO ./.

In/IN the/AT mornings/NNS ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ informed/VBN ,/, fluorescent/JJ tubes/NNS ,/, similar/JJ to/IN the/AT one/CD above/IN the/AT counter/NN ,/, illuminated/VBD the/AT entire/JJ hall/NN ./.

They/PPSS ,/, and/CC the/AT two/CD large/JJ fans/NNS which/WDT I/PPSS could/MD dimly/RB see/VB as/CS daylight/NN filtered/VBD through/IN their/PP$ vents/NNS ,/, down/RP at/IN the/AT far/JJ end/NN of/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, could/MD be/BE turned/VBN on/RP by/IN a/AT master/NN switch/NN situated/VBN inside/IN the/AT office/NN ./.

He/PPS pointed/VBD out/RP the/AT switch/NN to/IN me/PPO and/CC for/IN a/AT moment/NN I/PPSS foolishly/RB believed/VBD that/CS he/PPS would/MD let/VB deed/VB follow/VB words/NNS ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ shown/VBN ,/, instead/RB ,/, a/AT batch/NN of/IN white/JJ tickets/NNS of/IN the/AT sort/NN handed/VBN out/RP ,/, he/PPS told/VBD me/PPO ,/, every/AT morning/NN ./.

Now/RB ,/, here/RB was/BEDZ something/PN of/IN obvious/JJ importance/NN to/IN me/PPO ,/, yet/RB when/WRB I/PPSS reached/VBD for/IN the/AT tickets/NNS he/PPS snatched/VBD them/PPO away/RB from/IN my/PP$ hand/NN ./.

He/PPS couldn't/MD* afford/VB to/TO have/HV anyone/PN mess/VB around/RB with/IN them/PPO ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ./.

Each/DT of/IN those/DTS tickets/NNS was/BEDZ of/IN great/JJ value/NN to/IN its/PP$ rightful/JJ recipient/NN ./.

I/PPSS withdrew/VBD my/PP$ hand/NN ./.

Later/RBR I/PPSS would/MD remember/VB what/WDT this/DT pompous/JJ little/JJ man/NN had/HVD told/VBN me/PPO about/IN the/AT worth/NN of/IN a/AT ticket/NN ./.

Having/HVG nothing/PN else/RB to/TO do/DO except/IN wait/NN for/IN my/PP$ forms/NNS to/TO be/BE processed/VBN ,/, I/PPSS gave/VBD myself/PPL over/RP to/IN speculations/NNS concerning/IN the/AT hall/NN itself/PPL ./.

When/WRB suitably/RB lighted/VBN ,/, what/WDT would/MD it/PPO look/VB like/CS ?/. ?/.

The/AT presence/NN of/IN the/AT two/CD exhaust/NN fans/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO indicate/VB that/CS the/AT hall/NN could/MD become/VB crowded/VBN for/IN air/NN ./.

One/CD afternoon/NN ,/, upon/IN receiving/VBG permission/NN and/CC the/AT necessary/JJ instructions/NNS from/IN the/AT clerk/NN ,/, I/PPSS had/HVD visited/VBN the/AT toilet/NN adjoining/VBG the/AT hall/NN ./.

By/IN counting/VBG the/AT number/NN of/IN stalls/NNS and/CC urinals/NNS I/PPSS attempted/VBD to/TO form/VB a/AT loose/JJ estimate/NN of/IN how/WRB many/AP men/NNS the/AT hall/NN would/MD hold/VB at/IN one/CD time/NN ./.

For/CS although/CS I/PPSS had/HVD crossed/VBN a/AT corner/NN of/IN the/AT hall/NN on/IN my/PP$ way/NN to/IN the/AT toilet/NN I/PPSS still/RB could/MD not/* tell/VB for/IN sure/JJ how/WRB far/RB to/IN the/AT rear/NN the/AT darkness/NN extended/VBD ./.

I/PPSS could/MD observe/VB the/AT two/CD fans/NNS down/RP at/IN the/AT end/NN ,/, but/CC their/PP$ size/NN in/IN themselves/PPLS meant/VBD nothing/PN to/IN me/PPO as/QL long/JJ as/CS I/PPSS had/HVD no/AT measure/NN of/IN comparison/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD for/IN some/DTI time/NN been/BEN hoping/VBG ,/, in/IN vain/JJ ,/, for/IN one/CD of/IN the/AT dim/JJ figures/NNS to/TO pass/VB between/IN the/AT fan/NN vents/NNS and/CC myself/PPL ./.

I/PPSS knew/VBD that/CS three/CD or/CC four/CD of/IN them/PPO were/BED almost/QL always/RB present/RB in/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, but/CC what/WDT they/PPSS were/BED doing/VBG ,/, and/CC exactly/RB where/WRB ,/, I/PPSS could/MD not/* tell/VB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, I/PPSS felt/VBD ,/, possible/JJ that/CS they/PPSS were/BED men/NNS who/WPS ,/, having/HVG received/VBN no/AT tickets/NNS for/IN that/DT day/NN ,/, had/HVD remained/VBN in/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, to/TO sleep/VB perhaps/RB ,/, in/IN the/AT corners/NNS farthest/RBT removed/VBN from/IN the/AT counter/NN with/IN its/PP$ overhead/JJ light/NN ./.

This/DT light/NN did/DOD not/* penetrate/VB very/QL far/RB back/RB into/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, and/CC my/PP$ eyes/NNS were/BED hindered/VBN rather/IN than/CS aided/VBN by/IN the/AT dim/JJ daylight/NN entering/VBG through/IN the/AT fan/NN vents/NNS when/WRB I/PPSS tried/VBD to/TO pick/VB out/RP whatever/WDT might/MD be/BE lying/VBG ,/, or/CC squatting/VBG ,/, on/IN the/AT floor/NN below/RB ./.

Also/RB the/AT clerk/NN appeared/VBD to/TO disapprove/VB of/IN my/PP$ frequent/JJ curious/JJ glances/NNS back/VB over/IN my/PP$ shoulder/NN ./.

No/AT sooner/RBR would/MD I/PPSS turn/VB my/PP$ head/NN away/RB from/IN the/AT counter/NN before/CS he/PPS would/MD address/VB me/PPO ,/, at/IN times/NNS quite/QL sharply/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO bring/VB back/RB my/PP$ attention/NN ./.

And/CC I/PPSS had/HVD hardly/RB finished/VBN my/PP$ business/NN in/IN the/AT toilet/NN on/IN the/AT aforementioned/JJ occasion/NN when/WRB the/AT lights/NNS in/IN that/DT place/NN ,/, like/CS the/AT hall/NN lights/NNS controlled/VBN from/IN the/AT switch/NN in/IN the/AT office/NN ,/, flicked/VBD off/RP and/CC on/RP impatiently/RB ./.

This/DT sort/NN of/IN petty/JJ vigilance/NN annoyed/VBD me/PPO ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD certain/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ self-appointed/JJ ./.

It/PPS sprang/VBD from/IN a/AT type/NN of/IN mentality/NN I'd/PPSS+HVD encountered/VBN often/RB enough/QLP but/CC certainly/RB had/HVD not/* expected/VBN to/TO find/VB here/RB ./.

I/PPSS decided/VBD to/TO see/VB no/AT more/RBR of/IN the/AT clerk/NN until/CS the/AT processing/NN of/IN my/PP$ papers/NNS was/BEDZ completed/VBN ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD strongly/RB attached/VBN to/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, however/WRB ,/, and/CC hardly/RB a/AT day/NN passed/VBD when/WRB I/PPSS did/DOD not/* go/VB to/TO look/VB at/IN it/PPO from/IN a/AT distance/NN ./.

I/PPSS lived/VBD in/IN a/AT state/NN of/IN suspense/NN because/CS of/IN it/PPO ./.

I/PPSS could/MD not/* cling/VB to/IN my/PP$ past/NN nor/CC did/DOD I/PPSS wish/VB to/IN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD signed/VBN it/PPO off/RP on/IN the/AT forms/NNS ./.

My/PP$ future/NN lay/VBD solely/RB with/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, yet/RB what/WDT did/DOD I/PPSS know/VB about/IN the/AT hall/NN at/IN this/DT point/NN ?/. ?/.

Although/CS I/PPSS had/HVD been/BEN inside/IN it/PPO I/PPSS had/HVD not/* yet/RB seen/VBN it/PPS functioning/VBG ./.

I/PPSS wished/VBD to/TO prepare/VB myself/PPL but/CC did/DOD not/* even/VB know/VB what/WDT sort/NN of/IN clothes/NNS I/PPSS ought/MD to/TO be/BE wearing/VBG ./.

I/PPSS did/DOD not/* despair/VB ,/, however/WRB ;/. ;/.

far/RB from/IN it/PPO !/. !/.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ constantly/RB searching/VBG for/IN clues/NNS around/IN the/AT neighborhood/NN of/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

Though/CS only/RB a/AT relatively/QL short/JJ walk/NN separated/VBD it/PPO from/IN my/PP$ own/JJ part/NN of/IN town/NN ,/, its/PP$ character/NN was/BEDZ wholly/RB foreign/JJ to/IN me/PPO ./.

Large/JJ warehouses/NNS flanked/VBD the/AT street/NN on/IN which/WDT the/AT hall/NN fronted/VBD ./.

The/AT river/NN was/BEDZ only/RB a/AT few/AP blocks/NNS away/RB but/CC an/AT unbroken/JJ line/NN of/IN piers/NNS prevented/VBD me/PPO from/IN seeing/VBG it/PPO ./.

Sometimes/RB I/PPSS noticed/VBD the/AT tops/NNS of/IN ships'/NNS$ masts/NNS and/CC funnels/NNS reaching/VBG above/IN the/AT pier/NN roofs/NNS ./.

The/AT sounds/NNS issuing/VBG from/IN beyond/RB --/-- winches/NNS whirring/VBG ,/, men/NNS shouting/VBG --/-- indicated/VBD great/JJ activity/NN and/CC excited/VBN me/PPO ./.

The/AT hall/NN ,/, on/IN the/AT other/AP hand/NN ,/, appeared/VBD lifeless/JJ and/CC deserted/VBN on/IN these/DTS long/JJ waterfront/NN afternoons/NNS ./.

It/PPS resembled/VBD nothing/PN I'd/PPSS+HVD ever/RB seen/VBN before/RB ./.

Its/PP$ front/NN was/BEDZ windowless/JJ ,/, but/CC irregularities/NNS in/IN the/AT masonry/NN might/MD be/BE an/AT indication/NN that/CS windows/NNS ,/, now/RB blinded/VBN ,/, had/HVD once/RB looked/VBN out/RP upon/IN the/AT street/NN ./.

I/PPSS kept/VBD circling/VBG the/AT block/NN hoping/VBG to/TO see/VB ,/, from/IN the/AT street/NN behind/IN it/PPO ,/, the/AT rear/NN of/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

But/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ not/* a/AT tall/JJ structure/NN and/CC other/AP buildings/NNS concealed/VBD it/PPO ./.

For/IN weeks/NNS I/PPSS wandered/VBD about/IN this/DT neighborhood/NN of/IN warehouses/NNS and/CC garages/NNS ,/, truck/NN terminals/NNS and/CC taxi/NN repair/NN shops/NNS ,/, gasoline/NN pumps/NNS and/CC longshoremen's/NNS$ lunch/NN counters/NNS ,/, yet/RB never/RB did/DOD I/PPSS cease/VB to/TO feel/VB myself/PPL a/AT stranger/NN there/RB ./.

I/PPSS returned/VBD to/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, despite/IN my/PP$ dislike/NN for/IN the/AT clerk/NN ./.

As/CS I/PPSS had/HVD expected/VBN ,/, he/PPS insisted/VBD that/CS my/PP$ visits/NNS to/IN the/AT hall/NN would/MD do/DO nothing/PN to/TO further/VB the/AT process/NN of/IN my/PP$ application/NN ./.

Meanwhile/RB spring/NN had/HVD passed/VBN well/RB into/IN summer/NN ./.

At/IN last/AP ,/, when/WRB I/PPSS put/VB it/PPO to/IN him/PPO directly/RB ,/, the/AT clerk/NN was/BEDZ forced/VBN to/TO admit/VB that/CS the/AT delay/NN in/IN my/PP$ case/NN was/BEDZ unusual/JJ ./.

When/WRB I/PPSS asked/VBD him/PPO what/WDT ,/, if/CS anything/PN ,/, I/PPSS could/MD do/DO about/IN it/PPO ,/, he/PPS surprised/VBD me/PPO by/IN referring/VBG me/PPO to/IN the/AT director/NN of/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

I/PPSS could/MD consult/VB this/DT personage/NN on/IN any/DTI weekday/NN morning/NN ,/, though/CS not/* before/IN ten/CD o'clock/RB ./.

The/AT clerk/NN impressed/VBD this/DT upon/IN me/PPO :/: that/CS I/PPSS should/MD not/* arrive/VB in/IN the/AT hall/NN before/IN ten/CD o'clock/RB ./.

When/WRB I/PPSS went/VBD for/IN my/PP$ interview/NN with/IN the/AT director/NN I/PPSS saw/VBD why/WRB ./.

Although/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ dark/JJ as/QL usual/JJ I/PPSS could/MD see/VB that/CS the/AT hall/NN had/HVD only/RB recently/RB contained/VBN a/AT great/JJ many/AP people/NNS ./.

Cigarette/NN butts/NNS littered/VBD the/AT floor/NN ./.

The/AT big/JJ fans/NNS were/BED going/VBG ,/, drawing/VBG from/IN the/AT large/JJ room/NN the/AT remnants/NNS of/IN stale/JJ smoke/NN which/WDT drifted/VBD about/RB in/IN pale/JJ strata/NNS underneath/IN the/AT ceiling/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD felt/VBN the/AT draft/NN they/PPSS were/BED making/VBG while/CS mounting/VBG the/AT stairs/NNS ./.

The/AT staircase/NN itself/PPL seemed/VBD still/RB to/TO be/BE echoing/VBG the/AT heavy/JJ footfalls/NNS of/IN many/AP men/NNS ./.

I/PPSS stopped/VBD by/IN the/AT counter/NN ./.

No/AT one/PN was/BEDZ behind/IN it/PPO ,/, but/CC in/IN the/AT rear/JJ wall/NN of/IN the/AT office/NN I/PPSS noticed/VBD ,/, for/IN the/AT first/OD time/NN ,/, a/AT door/NN which/WDT had/HVD been/BEN left/VBN partially/RB open/JJ ./.

Past/IN it/PPO I/PPSS could/MD see/VB part/NN part/NN of/IN a/AT desk/NN ,/, a/AT flag/NN in/IN a/AT corner/NN ,/, a/AT rug/NN on/IN the/AT floor/NN ./.

The/AT director's/NN$ office/NN ./.

I/PPSS rapped/VBD my/PP$ knuckles/NNS on/IN the/AT counter/NN ./.

The/AT director/NN came/VBD to/IN the/AT door/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ at/IN once/RB disappointed/VBN ,/, although/CS just/RB what/WDT I/PPSS had/HVD expected/VBN him/PPO to/TO look/VB like/JJ I/PPSS could/MD not/* have/HV explained/VBN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT man/NN in/IN his/PP$ late/JJ forties/NNS ,/, with/IN graying/VBG hair/NN ,/, of/IN medium/NN height/NN ;/. ;/.

he/PPS looked/VBD dapper/JJ in/IN a/AT lightweight/JJ summer/NN suit/NN ,/, brown/JJ silk/NN tie/NN and/CC green-tinted/JJ soft/JJ collar/NN ./.

He/PPS wore/VBD perforated/VBN ,/, white-topped/JJ shoes/NNS ;/. ;/.

they/PPSS somehow/RB made/VBD me/PPO expect/VB to/TO see/VB him/PPO launch/VB into/IN a/AT vaudeville/NN tapdance/NN routine/NN any/DTI moment/NN ./.

But/CC he/PPS came/VBD toward/IN me/PPO sedately/RB enough/QLP ,/, showed/VBD me/PPO around/IN the/AT counter/NN ,/, offered/VBD me/PPO a/AT seat/NN inside/IN his/PP$ office/NN ,/, then/RB walked/VBD to/IN a/AT file/NN cabinet/NN and/CC got/VBD out/RP my/PP$ application/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD the/AT impression/NN that/CS he/PPS had/HVD read/VBN my/PP$ forms/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB several/AP times/NNS ./.

He/PPS did/DOD not/* look/VB at/IN them/PPO now/RB ./.

As/CS he/PPS lowered/VBD himself/PPL on/IN the/AT chair/NN behind/IN his/PP$ desk/NN I/PPSS wondered/VBD what/WDT this/DT dapper/JJ ,/, slightly/RB ridiculous/JJ man/NN could/MD possibly/RB have/HV to/TO do/DO with/IN the/AT workings/NNS of/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

He/PPS spoke/VBD ,/, in/IN a/AT voice/NN as/QL immaculate/JJ as/CS his/PP$ appearance/NN ./.

Why/WRB had/HVD I/PPSS registered/VBD ?/. ?/.

Begging/VBG my/PP$ pardon/NN ,/, he/PPS must/MD express/VB his/PP$ astonishment/NN over/IN seeing/VBG a/AT person/NN of/IN my/PP$ background/NN applying/VBG at/IN the/AT hall/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD looked/VBN over/IN my/PP$ forms/NNS and/CC was/BEDZ impressed/VBN by/IN what/WDT he/PPS had/HVD seen/VBN there/RB ;/. ;/.

indeed/RB ,/, my/PP$ scholastic/JJ qualifications/NNS were/BED such/JJ that/CS he/PPS ,/, a/AT college/NN graduate/NN himself/PPL ,/, must/MD envy/VB me/PPO them/PPO ./.

Was/BEDZ I/PPSS sure/JJ ,/, he/PPS asked/VBD ,/, that/CS I/PPSS knew/VBD what/WDT I/PPSS was/BEDZ applying/VBG for/IN ?/. ?/.

What/WDT sort/NN of/IN men/NNS I/PPSS would/MD come/VB into/IN contact/NN with/IN ,/, at/IN the/AT hall/NN ?/. ?/.

These/DTS questions/NNS did/DOD not/* surprise/VB me/PPO ;/. ;/.

I/PPSS felt/VBD certain/JJ that/CS the/AT director/NN ,/, like/CS the/AT afternoon/NN clerk/NN ,/, seldom/RB moved/VBD beyond/IN the/AT counter/NN ,/, that/CS the/AT hall/NN ,/, to/IN them/PPO ,/, was/BEDZ a/AT jungle/NN ,/, a/AT dark/JJ and/CC unwelcome/JJ place/NN ./.

Though/CS I/PPSS doubted/VBD that/CS he/PPS would/MD understand/VB me/PPO ,/, I/PPSS told/VBD the/AT director/NN my/PP$ motives/NNS for/IN applying/VBG ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD always/RB ,/, I/PPSS said/VBD ,/, hankered/VBD after/CS working/VBG hard/RB with/IN my/PP$ hands/NNS ./.

This/DT desire/NN ,/, I/PPSS went/VBD on/RP ,/, growing/VBG voluble/JJ as/CS my/PP$ conviction/NN was/BEDZ aroused/VBN ,/, had/HVD mounted/VBN at/IN such/ABL a/AT rate/NN recently/RB that/CS I/PPSS now/RB found/VBD its/PP$ realization/NN necessary/JJ not/* only/RB to/IN my/PP$ physical/JJ but/CC also/RB to/IN my/PP$ spiritual/JJ wellbeing/NN ./.

To/IN this/DT effect/NN I/PPSS had/HVD already/RB severed/VBN all/ABN connections/NNS which/WDT bound/VBD me/PPO to/IN my/PP$ former/AP existence/NN ./.

The/AT flat/JJ ,/, hard/JJ cap/NN was/BEDZ small/JJ ,/, but/CC he/PPS thrust/VBD it/PPO to/IN the/AT back/NN of/IN his/PP$ head/NN ./.

``/`` Tie/VB him/PPO up/RP ''/'' ./.

``/`` Hell/NN with/IN it/PPO ''/'' ./.

Before/CS they/PPSS could/MD guess/VB his/PP$ intention/NN Rankin/NP stepped/VBD forward/RB and/CC swung/VBD the/AT guard's/NN$ own/JJ gun/NN against/IN the/AT uncovered/VBN head/NN ,/, hard/RB ./.

The/AT man/NN went/VBD over/RP without/IN sound/NN ,/, falling/VBG to/IN the/AT bare/JJ floor/NN ./.

Barton/NP said/VBD harshly/RB ,/, ``/`` Why/WRB did/DOD you/PPO do/DO that/DT ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Rankin/NP sneered/VBD at/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` What/WDT did/DOD you/PPO want/VB me/PPO to/TO do/DO ,/, kiss/VB him/PPO ?/. ?/.

He/PPS dumped/VBD me/PPO in/IN solitary/JJ twice/RB ''/'' ./.

Barton/NP caught/VBD the/AT lighter/JJR man's/NN$ shoulder/NN and/CC swung/VBD him/PPO around/RB ./.

``/`` Let's/VB+PPO get/VB one/CD thing/NN straight/RB ,/, you/PPSS and/CC me/PPO ./.

Fred/NP Rankin/NP looked/VBD at/IN him/PPO ./.

It/PPS seemed/VBD to/IN Barton/NP that/CS the/AT green/JJ eyes/NNS mocked/VBD him/PPO ,/, the/AT thin-lipped/JJ smile/NN held/VBD insolence/NN ,/, but/CC he/PPS had/HVD no/AT time/NN to/TO waste/VB now/RB ./.

``/`` Come/VB on/RP ./.

They/PPSS filed/VBD out/RP through/IN the/AT guard-room/NN door/NN ,/, into/IN the/AT paved/VBN square/NN ./.

They/PPSS had/HVD chosen/VBN this/DT night/NN purposely/RB ./.

They/PPSS reached/VBD the/AT guard/NN house/NN without/IN alerting/VBG the/AT men/NNS on/IN the/AT walls/NNS above/RB ,/, and/CC Powers/NP slipped/VBD through/IN the/AT door/NN ./.

Even/RB Barton/NP could/MD not/* quite/RB believe/VB it/PPO ./.

If/CS she/PPS sensed/VBD any/DTI unusual/JJ preoccupation/NN on/IN the/AT part/NN of/IN her/PPO mother/NN ,/, she/PPS did/DOD not/* comment/VB upon/IN it/PPO ./.

After/CS they/PPSS had/HVD finished/VBN eating/VBG ,/, Melissa/NP took/VBD Sprite/NP the/AT kitten/NN under/IN her/PP$ arm/NN --/-- ``/`` so/CS that/CS Auntie/NP Grace/NP can/MD teach/VB it/PPO about/IN the/AT whistle/NN ''/'' --/-- and/CC climbed/VBD into/IN the/AT station/NN wagon/NN beside/IN her/PPO mother/NN ./.

When/WRB they/PPSS reached/VBD their/PP$ neighbor's/NN$ house/NN ,/, Pamela/NP said/VBD a/AT few/AP polite/JJ words/NNS to/IN Grace/NP and/CC kissed/VBD Melissa/NP lightly/RB on/IN the/AT forehead/NN ,/, the/AT impulse/NN prompted/VBN by/IN a/AT stray/JJ thought/NN --/-- of/IN the/AT type/NN to/IN which/WDT she/PPS was/BEDZ frequently/RB subject/JJ these/DTS days/NNS --/-- that/CS they/PPSS might/MD never/RB see/VB one/CD another/DT again/RB ./.

She/PPS must/MD be/BE cautious/JJ so/CS as/CS not/* to/TO alert/VB the/AT scheming/VBG forest/NN ./.

All/ABN of/IN her/PPO movements/NNS were/BED careful/JJ and/CC methodical/JJ ,/, partaking/VBG of/IN the/AT stealth/NN of/IN a/AT criminal/NN who/WPS has/HVZ plotted/VBN his/PP$ felony/NN for/IN months/NNS in/IN advance/NN and/CC knows/VBZ exactly/RB which/WDT step/NN to/TO take/VB next/RB in/IN the/AT course/NN of/IN the/AT final/JJ execution/NN of/IN his/PP$ crime/NN ./.

In/IN her/PP$ grim/JJ pursuit/NN of/IN tranquillity/NN ,/, Pamela/NP focused/VBD her/PPO thoughts/NNS on/IN her/PP$ husband/NN ./.

The/AT mountainside/NN grew/VBD steeper/JJR and/CC she/PPS slipped/VBD once/RB or/CC twice/RB on/IN the/AT smooth/JJ pine/NN needles/NNS ./.

The/AT trees/NNS huddled/VBD more/QL closely/RB together/RB ,/, their/PP$ limbs/NNS and/CC leaves/NNS intertwined/VBD in/IN a/AT coarse/JJ curtain/NN against/IN the/AT sun/NN ./.

Bushes/NNS and/CC vines/NNS abetted/VBD the/AT rocks/NNS in/IN forming/VBG thorny/JJ detours/NNS for/IN the/AT struggling/VBG stranger/NN ,/, and/CC without/IN the/AT direct/JJ light/NN of/IN the/AT sun/NN to/TO act/VB as/CS compass/NN ,/, Pamela/NP could/MD no/AT longer/JJR be/BE positive/JJ of/IN her/PPO direction/NN ./.

The/AT forest/NN had/HVD become/VBN an/AT alien/JJ world/NN where/WRB she/PPS strove/VBD ,/, alone/RB ,/, unprotected/JJ ,/, unguided/JJ ,/, to/TO deal/VB with/IN whatever/WDT hindrances/NNS were/BED offered/VBN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT bold/JJ ,/, dark/JJ castle/NN of/IN pine/NN boughs/NNS that/WPS stood/VBD like/CS a/AT medieval/JJ fortress/NN ,/, eclipsing/VBG the/AT sun/NN and/CC human/NN time/NN ./.

At/IN one/CD and/CC the/AT same/AP time/NN ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ within/IN it/PPO but/CC still/RB searching/VBG for/IN the/AT drawbridge/NN that/WPS would/MD give/VB her/PPO entry/NN ./.

Silence/NN came/VBD into/IN the/AT forest/NN --/-- a/AT solid/JJ being/NN that/WPS clapped/VBD its/PP$ hand/NN over/IN the/AT murmuring/VBG mouths/NNS of/IN the/AT birds/NNS and/CC the/AT whispered/VBN comfort/NN of/IN the/AT trees/NNS ./.

Silence/NN walked/VBD at/IN Pamela's/NP$ side/NN ,/, its/PP$ presence/NN numbingly/RB close/RB ,/, yet/RB too/QL far/JJ for/IN her/PPO to/TO hear/VB ./.

Silence/NN stood/VBD in/IN front/NN of/IN her/PPO ,/, waiting/VBG ,/, and/CC in/IN back/NN of/IN her/PPO ,/, blocking/VBG her/PP$ retreat/NN ./.

She/PPS stumbled/VBD over/IN the/AT root/NN of/IN a/AT tree/NN that/WPS protruded/VBD maliciously/RB above/IN the/AT earth/NN ./.

In/IN spite/NN of/IN her/PP$ attempt/NN to/TO preserve/VB her/PP$ balance/NN ,/, she/PPS fell/VBD ,/, bruising/VBG her/PP$ arm/NN on/IN a/AT naked/JJ stone/NN ./.

She/PPS started/VBD to/TO brush/VB the/AT dirt/NN and/CC bits/NNS of/IN leaves/NNS off/IN her/PP$ clothes/NNS ./.

Her/PP$ arm/NN bled/VBD slightly/RB ,/, and/CC the/AT offended/VBN skin/NN cried/VBD out/RP in/IN pain/NN ./.

She/PPS looked/VBD around/RB ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ bewildered/VBN ./.

She/PPS seemed/VBD to/TO have/HV come/VBN such/ABL a/AT long/JJ distance/NN --/-- too/QL far/RB for/IN her/PP$ destination/NN which/WDT had/HVD wilfully/RB been/BEN swallowed/VBN up/RP in/IN the/AT greedy/JJ gloom/NN of/IN the/AT trees/NNS ./.

The/AT trees/NNS were/BED crowded/VBN so/QL closely/RB together/RB that/CS their/PP$ branches/NNS overlapped/VBD ,/, virtually/RB shutting/VBG out/RP the/AT sun/NN completely/RB ./.

The/AT earth/NN smelled/VBD moist/JJ and/CC pungent/JJ as/CS it/PPS might/MD in/IN a/AT cave/NN deprived/VBN of/IN the/AT cleansing/VBG effect/NN of/IN the/AT sun's/NN$ rays/NNS ./.

She/PPS had/HVD the/AT feeling/NN that/CS ,/, under/IN the/AT mouldering/VBG leaves/NNS ,/, there/EX would/MD be/BE the/AT bodies/NNS of/IN dead/JJ animals/NNS ,/, quietly/RB decaying/VBG and/CC giving/VBG their/PP$ soil/NN back/RB to/IN the/AT mountain/NN ./.

The/AT thought/NN made/VBD Pamela/NP shudder/VB ./.

A/AT terrible/JJ chill/NN swept/VBD through/IN the/AT grove/NN ./.

Not/* a/AT breeze/NN exactly/RB ,/, but/CC a/AT pocket/NN of/IN icy/JJ air/NN that/WPS settled/VBD with/IN a/AT loathsome/JJ familiarity/NN upon/IN the/AT deep/JJ confines/NNS of/IN the/AT grove/NN ,/, catching/VBG Pamela/NP in/IN a/AT leering/VBG embrace/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT peculiar/JJ density/NN about/IN it/PPO ,/, a/AT thick/JJ substance/NN that/WPS could/MD be/BE sensed/VBN but/CC never/RB identified/VBN ,/, never/RB actually/RB perceived/VBN ./.

She/PPS already/RB knew/VBD this/DT unwholesome/JJ ,/, chilling/VBG atmosphere/NN that/WPS was/BEDZ somehow/RB grotesquely/RB alive/JJ ./.

It/PPS enclosed/VBD her/PPO clammy/JJ hands/NNS and/CC twined/VBD around/IN her/PP$ ankles/NNS ./.

It/PPS crept/VBD into/IN the/AT open/JJ neck/NN of/IN her/PPO blouse/NN and/CC slid/VBD down/IN her/PP$ body/NN ,/, seeping/VBG into/IN her/PPO flesh/NN through/IN all/ABN the/AT quivering/VBG pores/NNS of/IN her/PPO skin/NN ./.

It/PPS crawled/VBD across/IN her/PP$ breasts/NNS ,/, suffocating/VBG the/AT life/NN in/IN her/PP$ nipples/NNS ./.

It/PPS circled/VBD her/PPO thighs/NNS ,/, exploring/VBG with/IN its/PP$ icy/JJ tentacles/NNS ./.

It/PPS entered/VBD her/PPO body/NN with/IN the/AT ghastly/JJ intimacy/NN of/IN an/AT incubus/NN ,/, and/CC its/PP$ particles/NNS ,/, spreading/VBG ,/, creeping/VBG ,/, crawling/VBG ,/, joined/VBD themselves/PPLS into/IN steel/NN bands/NNS that/WPS constricted/VBD her/PP$ knees/NNS so/QL tightly/RB that/CS they/PPSS ached/VBD ;/. ;/.

stifled/VBN her/PP$ lungs/NNS so/CS that/CS her/PP$ breath/NN came/VBD in/IN harsh/JJ gasps/NNS ;/. ;/.

clutched/VBN her/PP$ throat/NN and/CC sucked/VBD up/RP the/AT moisture/NN in/IN her/PP$ mouth/NN so/CS that/CS her/PP$ tongue/NN was/BEDZ dry/JJ and/CC hard/JJ and/CC stuck/VBD to/IN the/AT roof/NN of/IN her/PPO mouth/NN and/CC her/PP$ teeth/NNS were/BED clenched/VBN together/RB in/IN the/AT rigid/JJ fixture/NN of/IN her/PPO jaws/NNS ./.

She/PPS had/HVD to/TO get/VB away/RB from/IN here/RB before/CS this/DT demoniac/JJ possession/NN swallowed/VBD up/RP the/AT liquid/NN of/IN her/PPO eyes/NNS and/CC sank/VBD into/IN the/AT fibers/NNS of/IN her/PP$ brain/NN ,/, depriving/VBG her/PPO of/IN reason/NN and/CC sight/NN ./.

But/CC she/PPS did/DOD not/* know/VB which/WDT way/NN to/TO go/VB ./.

The/AT shadows/NNS of/IN the/AT trees/NNS engulfed/VBD her/PPO ,/, foreclosing/VBG every/AT possible/JJ exit/NN from/IN the/AT grove/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD been/BEN snared/VBN here/RB by/IN a/AT vile/JJ sensuality/NN that/WPS writhed/VBD around/IN her/PP$ throat/NN in/IN ever-tightening/JJ circles/NNS ./.

Pamela/NP groped/VBD blindly/RB ./.

She/PPS had/HVD to/TO escape/VB ./.

She/PPS had/HVD to/TO move/VB in/IN some/DTI direction/NN --/-- any/DTI direction/NN that/WPS would/MD take/VB her/PPO away/RB from/IN this/DT evil/JJ place/NN ./.

She/PPS thrust/VBD forward/RB through/IN the/AT shadows/NNS and/CC the/AT trees/NNS that/WPS resisted/VBD her/PPO and/CC tried/VBD to/TO fling/VB her/PPO back/RB ./.

Her/PP$ own/JJ body/NN protested/VBD ,/, aching/VBG painfully/RB where/WRB the/AT blood/NN in/IN her/PP$ veins/NNS had/HVD congealed/VBN ,/, where/WRB cold/JJ demon/NN wisps/NNS still/RB clung/VBD and/CC caressed/VBD ./.

Every/AT movement/NN she/PPS made/VBD seemed/VBN unnecessarily/RB noisy/JJ ./.

Twigs/NNS cracked/VBD loudly/RB under/IN her/PP$ feet/NNS ;/. ;/.

Miraculously/RB ,/, she/PPS found/VBD exactly/RB the/AT right/JJ statement/NN ./.

She/PPS began/VBD it/PPO deliberately/RB ,/, so/CS that/CS none/PN of/IN her/PPO words/NNS would/MD be/BE lost/VBN on/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` I/PPSS want/VB to/TO tell/VB you/PPO something/PN Thomas/NP DeMontez/NP Lord/NP ./.

Beaming/VBG idiotically/RB ,/, he/PPS pooched/VBD out/RP his/PP$ lips/NNS and/CC attempted/VBD to/TO kiss/VB her/PPO ./.

He/PPS grinned/VBD ,/, nodded/VBD ,/, and/CC walked/VBD around/RB to/IN the/AT front/NN of/IN the/AT car/NN ./.

Lips/NNS pursed/VBD mournfully/RB ,/, he/PPS stared/VBD down/RP at/IN its/PP$ crazily/RB sagging/VBG left/JJ side/NN ./.

Then/RB he/PPS hunkered/VBD down/RP on/IN the/AT heels/NNS of/IN his/PP$ handmade/JJ boots/NNS ,/, peered/VBD into/IN the/AT orderly/JJ chaos/NN of/IN axle/NN ,/, shock/NN absorber/NN ,/, and/CC spring/NN ./.

He/PPS went/VBD prone/RB on/IN his/PP$ stomach/NN ,/, the/AT better/JJR to/TO pursue/VB his/PP$ examination/NN ./.

Along/RB with/IN this/DT self-satisfaction/NN ,/, however/WRB ,/, Joyce/NP sensed/VBD a/AT growing/VBG tension/NN ./.

No/AT sooner/RBR had/HVD I/PPSS started/VBD drinking/VBG than/CS the/AT driver/NN started/VBD zigzagging/VBG the/AT truck/NN ./.

The/AT beer/NN foamed/VBD furiously/RB ./.

A/AT long/JJ time/NN ./.

Emptied/VBD the/AT bottle/NN ./.

Teeth/NNS again/RB flashing/VBG back/RB at/IN me/PPO ,/, the/AT driver/NN released/VBD a/AT deluge/NN of/IN Spanish/NP in/IN which/WDT ``/`` amigo/NN ''/'' appeared/VBD every/AT so/QL often/RB like/CS an/AT island/NN in/IN the/AT stormy/JJ waves/NNS of/IN surrounding/VBG sound/NN ./.

The/AT car/NN was/BEDZ approaching/VBG fast/RB ./.

On/IN the/AT truck/NN bed/NN there/EX was/BEDZ nothing/PN smaller/JJR than/CS a/AT piece/NN of/IN rusty/JJ machinery/NN ;/. ;/.

the/AT car's/NN$ far/JJ windshield/NN panel/NN turned/VBD into/IN a/AT silver/NN web/NN with/IN a/AT dark/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/AT center/NN ./.

I/PPSS heard/VBD the/AT screech/NN of/IN brakes/NNS behind/IN me/PPO ,/, an/AT insane/JJ burst/NN of/IN laughter/NN beneath/IN me/PPO ./.

Looking/VBG back/RB I/PPSS saw/VBD a/AT gray-haired/JJ man/NN getting/VBG out/IN of/IN his/PP$ halted/VBN car/NN and/CC trying/VBG to/TO read/VB our/PP$ license/NN number/NN ./.

I/PPSS saw/VBD Johnson's/NP$ bottle/NN snatched/VBN from/IN his/PP$ hand/NN ,/, saw/VBD it/PPS go/VB in/IN a/AT swirl/NN of/IN foam/NN just/RB behind/IN the/AT second/OD car/NN ./.

I/PPSS swam/VBD like/CS mad/JJ ,/, got/VBD out/IN of/IN the/AT pool/NN ,/, grabbed/VBD my/PP$ robe/NN ,/, and/CC ran/VBD to/IN the/AT car/NN ./.

The/AT keys/NNS were/BED still/RB in/IN it/PPO ,/, and/CC I/PPSS was/BEDZ miles/NNS away/RB before/CS I/PPSS remembered/VBD that/CS my/PP$ clothes/NNS and/CC purse/NN and/CC everything/PN were/BED still/RB in/IN the/AT little/AP cabana/NN where/WRB I'd/PPSS+HVD changed/VBN ''/'' ./.

She'd/PPS+HVD driven/VBN around/RB for/IN a/AT while/NN ,/, Joyce/NP said/VBD ,/, then/RB ,/, thinking/VBG Louis/NP Thor/NP would/MD have/HV calmed/VBN down/RP by/IN that/DT time/NN ,/, she'd/PPS+HVD gone/VBN back/RB to/IN his/PP$ home/NR on/IN Bryn/NP Mawr/NP Drive/NN ,/, parked/VBD in/IN front/NN ,/, and/CC walked/VBD toward/IN the/AT pool/NN ./.

She/PPS went/VBD on/RP :/:

``/`` A/AT man/NN was/BEDZ holding/VBG onto/IN Lou/NP ,/, holding/VBG him/PPO up/RP ./.

Maybe/RB Lou/NP was/BEDZ only/RB unconscious/JJ ,/, but/CC right/QL then/RB I/PPSS thought/VBD he/PPS must/MD be/BE dead/JJ ./.

The/AT man/NN shoved/VBD him/PPO into/IN the/AT water/NN ,/, then/RB ran/VBD past/IN the/AT cabana/NN ./.

There's/EX+BEZ a/AT walk/NN there/RB that/WPS goes/VBZ out/IN to/IN Quebec/NP Drive/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ so/QL scared/VBN well/UH ,/, I/PPSS just/RB ran/VBD to/IN my/PP$ car/NN and/CC came/VBD here/RB ''/'' ./.

``/`` You/PPSS know/VB who/WPS the/AT other/AP man/NN was/BEDZ ''/'' ?/. ?/.

But/CC I'm/PPSS+BEM sure/JJ the/AT other/AP one/PN was/BEDZ Lou/NP ''/'' ./.

What/WDT Joyce/NP wanted/VBD me/PPO to/TO do/DO was/BEDZ go/VB to/IN Thor's/NP$ house/NN and/CC ``/`` do/DO whatever/WDT detectives/NNS do/DO ''/'' ,/, and/CC get/VB her/PP$ clothes/NNS --/-- and/CC handbag/NN containing/VBG her/PP$ identification/NN ./.

She/PPS realized/VBD I'd/PPSS+MD have/HV to/TO notify/VB the/AT police/NN ,/, but/CC fervently/RB hoped/VBD I/PPSS could/MD avoid/VB mentioning/VBG her/PP$ name/NN ./.

Her/PP$ impact/NN in/IN the/AT zing/NP commercials/NNS had/HVD led/VBN to/IN her/PP$ being/BEG considered/VBN for/IN an/AT excellent/JJ part/NN in/IN an/AT upcoming/JJ TV/NP series/NN ,/, Underwater/JJ Western/JJ Eye/NN ,/, a/AT documentary-type/JJ show/NN to/TO be/BE sponsored/VBN by/IN Oatnut/NP Grits/NNS ./.

``/`` And/CC I/PPSS so/QL want/VB the/AT part/NN ''/'' ,/, she/PPS said/VBD ./.

``/`` The/AT commercials/NNS have/HV just/RB been/BEN for/IN money/NN ,/, there/EX hasn't/HVZ* been/BEN any/DTI real/JJ incentive/NN for/IN me/PPO to/TO do/DO them/PPO ,/, but/CC in/IN Underwater/JJ Western/JJ Eye/NN I'd/PPSS+MD have/HV a/AT chance/NN to/TO act/VB ./.

``/`` I'm/PPSS+BEM starting/VBG to/TO itch/VB ''/'' ,/, she/PPS said/VBD ./.

``/`` Yes/RB ,/, I'm/PPSS+BEM still/RB all/QL covered/VBN with/IN that/DT soap/NN ./.

I/PPSS spun/VBD about/RB and/CC clattered/VBD through/IN the/AT front/JJ room/NN to/IN the/AT door/NN ./.

As/CS I/PPSS went/VBD out/RP ,/, I/PPSS could/MD hear/VB water/NN pouring/VBG in/IN the/AT shower/NN ./.

She/PPS wouldn't/MD* be/BE taking/VBG a/AT cold/JJ shower/NN ./.

Bryn/NP Mawr/NP Drive/NN is/BEZ only/RB two/CD or/CC three/CD miles/NNS from/IN the/AT Spartan/NP ,/, and/CC it/PPS took/VBD me/PPO less/AP than/IN five/CD minutes/NNS to/TO get/VB there/RB ./.

But/CC the/AT scene/NN was/BEDZ not/* the/AT quiet/JJ ,/, calm/JJ scene/NN I'd/PPSS+HVD expected/VBN ./.

Four/CD cars/NNS were/BED parked/VBN at/IN the/AT curb/NN ,/, and/CC two/CD of/IN them/PPO were/BED police/NN radio/NN cars/NNS ./.

I/PPSS followed/VBD a/AT shrubbery-lined/JJ gravel/NN path/NN alongside/IN the/AT house/NN to/IN the/AT pool/NN ./.

Two/CD uniformed/JJ officers/NNS ,/, a/AT couple/NN of/IN plain-clothesmen/NNS I/PPSS knew/VBD ,/, and/CC two/CD other/AP men/NNS stood/VBD on/IN a/AT gray/JJ cement/NN area/NN next/IN to/IN the/AT pool/NN on/IN my/PP$ left/NR ./.

``/`` How'd/WRB+DOD you/PPSS hear/VB about/IN this/DT one/CD ''/'' ?/. ?/.

I/PPSS grinned/VBD ,/, but/CC ignored/VBD the/AT question/NN ./.

Rawlins/NP worked/VBD out/IN of/IN Central/JJ Homicide/NN and/CC we'd/PPSS+HVD been/BEN friends/NNS for/IN years/NNS ./.

He/PPS filled/VBD me/PPO in/RP ./.

A/AT call/NN to/IN the/AT police/NNS had/HVD been/BEN placed/VBN from/IN here/RB a/AT couple/NN of/IN minutes/NNS after/IN nine/CD P.M./RB ,/, and/CC the/AT first/OD police/NN car/NN had/HVD arrived/VBN two/CD or/CC three/CD minutes/NNS after/IN that/DT --/-- 10/CD minutes/NNS ago/RB now/RB ./.

those/DTS who/WPS wrote/VBD them/PPO knew/VBD people/NNS and/CC what/WDT made/VBD people/NNS tick/VB ./.

I/PPSS loved/VBD the/AT city/NN and/CC I/PPSS particularly/RB loved/VBD the/AT gaiety/NN and/CC spirit/NN of/IN Mardi/NP Gras/NP ./.

My/PP$ Uncle/NN and/CC I/PPSS were/BED not/* too/QL close/JJ socially/RB because/CS of/IN the/AT difference/NN in/IN our/PP$ ages/NNS ./.

She/PPS looked/VBD more/AP like/CS twenty-five/CD or/CC six/CD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ really/RB a/AT May/NP and/CC December/NP combination/NN ./.

My/PP$ new/JJ Aunt/NN was/BEDZ perhaps/RB three/CD or/CC four/CD years/NNS older/JJR than/CS I/PPSS and/CC it/PPS had/HVD been/BEN a/AT long/JJ time/NN since/CS I/PPSS had/HVD seen/VBN as/QL gorgeous/JJ a/AT woman/NN who/WPS oozed/VBD sex/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ something/PN about/IN the/AT contour/NN of/IN her/PP$ face/NN ,/, her/PP$ smile/NN that/WPS was/BEDZ like/CS New/JJ Orleans/NP sunshine/NN ,/, the/AT way/NN she/PPS held/VBD her/PP$ head/NN ,/, the/AT way/NN she/PPS walked/VBD --/-- there/EX was/BEDZ scarcely/RB anything/PN she/PPS did/DOD which/WDT did/DOD not/* fascinate/VB me/PPO ./.

You/PPSS must/MD forgive/VB me/PPO if/CS I/PPSS seem/VB to/TO dwell/VB too/QL much/RB on/IN her/PP$ physical/JJ aspects/NNS but/CC I/PPSS am/BEM an/AT artist/NN ,/, accustomed/VBN to/IN studying/VBG the/AT physical/JJ body/NN ./.

True/RB ,/, she/PPS was/BEDZ my/PP$ Aunt/NN ,/, married/VBN to/IN an/AT Uncle/NN related/VBD to/IN me/PPO only/RB by/IN marriage/NN ,/, but/CC why/WRB she/PPS had/HVD married/VBN a/AT man/NN twice/RB her/PP$ age/NN ,/, and/CC more/AP ,/, perhaps/RB ,/, I/PPSS did/DOD not/* know/VB or/CC much/RB care/VB ./.

I/PPSS dismissed/VBD these/DTS feelings/NNS as/CS wishful/JJ thinking/NN but/CC I/PPSS could/MD not/* get/VB it/PPO out/IN of/IN my/PP$ head/NN that/CS we/PPSS had/HVD a/AT strong/JJ physical/JJ attraction/NN for/IN one/DTX another/DT and/CC we/PPSS both/ABX feared/VBD to/TO dwell/VB on/IN it/PPO because/CS of/IN our/PP$ relationship/NN ./.

I/PPSS myself/PPL was/BEDZ fond/JJ of/IN him/PPO but/CC what/WDT a/AT young/JJ woman/NN half/ABN his/PP$ age/NN saw/VBD in/IN him/PPO was/BEDZ a/AT mystery/NN to/IN me/PPO ./.

For/IN several/AP weeks/NNS we/PPSS eyed/VBD one/DTX another/DT almost/RB like/CS sparring/VBG partners/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB one/CD day/NN Uncle/NN was/BEDZ slightly/RB indisposed/VBN and/CC stayed/VBD home/NR ;/. ;/.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ waiting/VBG in/IN front/NN of/IN it/PPO when/WRB she/PPS showed/VBD up/RP and/CC told/VBD me/PPO of/IN my/PP$ Uncle's/NN$ indisposition/NN ./.

Even/RB as/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ telling/VBG me/PPO about/IN it/PPO I/PPSS became/VBD aware/JJ of/IN a/AT give-away/JJ flush/NN that/WPS suffused/VBD her/PP$ neck/NN and/CC moved/VBD upwards/RB to/IN her/PP$ cheeks/NNS ,/, and/CC subconsciously/RB I/PPSS realized/VBD that/CS when/WRB she/PPS entered/VBD the/AT store/NN she/PPS did/DOD not/* switch/VB on/RP the/AT lights/NNS ./.

The/AT cavernous/JJ depth/NN ,/, cluttered/VBN with/IN antiques/NNS ,/, echoed/VBD to/IN her/PP$ hard/JJ heels/NNS as/CS she/PPS walked/VBD directly/RB to/IN the/AT office/NN in/IN the/AT rear/NN and/CC took/VBD the/AT seat/NN at/IN his/PP$ desk/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ aware/JJ of/IN a/AT humid/JJ look/NN in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS that/WPS told/VBD me/PPO the/AT time/NN was/BEDZ opportune/JJ ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ little/AP likelihood/NN of/IN any/DTI customers/NNS walking/VBG in/RP at/IN that/DT hour/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ standing/VBG beside/IN her/PPO ,/, watching/VBG the/AT outspread/VBN palms/NNS and/CC wondering/VBG about/IN the/AT old/JJ horsehair/NN sofa/NN against/IN the/AT wall/NN on/IN which/WDT he/PPS sometimes/RB napped/VBD ./.

I/PPSS bent/VBD and/CC kissed/VBD the/AT still/QL pink/JJ neck/NN and/CC suddenly/RB she/PPS jumped/VBD up/RP ,/, and/CC her/PP$ two/CD arms/NNS encircled/VBD me/PPO in/IN a/AT bear-like/JJ crush/NN ./.

She/PPS set/VBD down/RP her/PP$ suitcase/NN ./.

Smiling/VBG ,/, she/PPS sat/VBD down/RP on/IN the/AT suitcase/NN and/CC waited/VBD and/CC watched/VBD ./.

The/AT sun/NN grew/VBD hotter/JJR as/CS it/PPS approached/VBD the/AT midday/NN ./.

Nicolas/NP was/BEDZ dreaming/VBG he/PPS had/HVD his/PP$ head/NN pressed/VBN against/IN the/AT dashboard/NN of/IN a/AT speeding/VBG car/NN ./.

He/PPS began/VBD sweating/VBG ./.

Mary/NP Jane/NP got/VBD up/RP ,/, quietly/RB ,/, and/CC walked/VBD away/RB ./.

Twenty/CD minutes/NNS later/RBR she/PPS was/BEDZ at/IN the/AT desk/NN of/IN the/AT Grafin's/NP$ pension/NN ,/, her/PP$ tears/NNS dried/VBN ,/, signing/VBG a/AT hotel/NN form/NN and/CC asking/VBG for/IN a/AT bath/NN ./.

The/AT Grafin/NP ,/, who/WPS was/BEDZ charmed/VBN by/IN her/PPO ,/, told/VBD her/PPO ,/, ``/`` Your/PP$ sister/NN who/WPS was/BEDZ here/RB two/CD years/NNS ago/RB has/HVZ quite/QL dark/JJ hair/NN ./.

Rather/QL erotically/RB he/PPS listened/VBD to/IN the/AT bath/NN water/NN running/VBG ;/. ;/.

Her/PP$ white/JJ blond/JJ hair/NN was/BEDZ clean/JJ and/CC brushed/VBN long/JJ straight/RB down/RP to/IN her/PP$ shoulders/NNS ./.

Perhaps/RB her/PP$ eyes/NNS were/BED larger/JJR and/CC more/AP of/IN a/AT summer/NN blue/JJ for/IN all/ABN they/PPSS had/HVD seen/VBN and/CC wept/VBN that/DT day/NN ./.

Her/PP$ face/NN was/BEDZ pale/JJ but/CC set/VBN and/CC her/PP$ dark/JJ eyes/NNS smoldered/VBD with/IN blame/NN for/IN Ben/NP ./.

``/`` There's/EX+BEZ the/AT one/PN who's/WPS+BEZ lucky/JJ ''/'' !/. !/.

A/AT terrible/JJ ,/, numbing/VBG sense/NN of/IN futility/NN swept/VBD over/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT girl/NN in/IN the/AT prow/NN of/IN the/AT outrigger/NN turned/VBD a/AT smile/NN like/CS a/AT beacon/NN on/IN me/PPO ./.

From/IN L'Turu/NP ,/, I/PPSS heard/VBD that/CS until/CS about/IN 1850/CD the/AT people/NNS of/IN this/DT island/NN --/-- which/WDT was/BEDZ about/IN the/AT size/NN of/IN Guam/NP or/CC smaller/JJR --/-- had/HVD been/BEN of/IN both/ABX sexes/NNS ,/, and/CC that/CS the/AT normal/JJ family/NN life/NN of/IN Melanesian/NP tribes/NNS was/BEDZ observed/VBN here/RB with/IN minor/JJ variations/NNS ./.

The/AT man/NN took/VBD two/CD short/JJ steps/NNS backward/RB then/RB sat/VBD down/RP heavily/RB on/IN the/AT pavement/NN ./.

A/AT shine/NN in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS suddenly/RB became/VBD tears/NNS and/CC she/PPS turned/VBD back/RB to/IN her/PP$ husband/NN again/RB ./.

Matsuo/NP lifted/VBD his/PP$ rifle/NN ,/, easing/VBG the/AT sling/NN under/IN his/PP$ left/JJ upper/JJ arm/NN for/IN steadiness/NN ./.

A/AT wave/NN of/IN flame/NN rippling/VBG through/IN their/PP$ cave/NN had/HVD reached/VBN Nagamo/NP ,/, his/PP$ friend/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN a/AT shriek/NN the/AT man/NN bolted/VBD through/IN the/AT entrance/NN ,/, then/RB slowed/VBD to/IN the/AT jerky/JJ walk/NN of/IN a/AT puppet/NN ,/, his/PP$ uniform/NN blazing/VBG ./.

The/AT callous/JJ marines/NNS had/HVD laughed/VBN at/IN each/DT other's/AP$ retching/NN ,/, while/CS stacking/VBG bodies/NNS ./.

At/IN nightfall/NN he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN able/JJ to/TO sneak/VB down/IN a/AT hillside/NN and/CC into/IN the/AT jungle/NN ,/, reeking/VBG of/IN death/NN ./.

A/AT spectacle/NN occurred/VBD across/IN the/AT meadow/NN :/: the/AT lone/JJ marine/NN took/VBD a/AT seat/NN on/IN the/AT ground/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT shot/NN reverberated/VBD in/IN diminishing/VBG whiplashes/NNS of/IN sound/NN ./.

Like/CS a/AT mischievous/JJ boy/NN expecting/VBG punishment/NN ,/, Matsuo/NP awaited/VBD reaction/NN from/IN the/AT jungle/NN ./.

Matsuo/NP puzzled/VBD and/CC grew/VBD anxious/JJ over/IN the/AT complete/JJ passiveness/NN ,/, concluding/VBG that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT butt/NN of/IN a/AT devilish/JJ joke/NN ./.

Five/CD or/CC so/RB minutes/NNS later/RBR the/AT marine/NN abruptly/RB pulled/VBD up/RP and/CC stepped/VBD into/IN sunlight/NN ,/, immediately/RB throwing/VBG his/PP$ hands/NNS over/IN his/PP$ eyes/NNS ./.

With/IN a/AT sudden/JJ decisiveness/NN he/PPS lurched/VBD in/IN Matsuo's/NP$ direction/NN ,/, crossing/VBG the/AT meadow/NN in/IN a/AT zigzagging/VBG gallop/NN ./.

When/WRB he/PPS got/VBD closer/RBR to/IN the/AT tree/NN ,/, Matsuo/NP noted/VBD the/AT wild/JJ look/NN on/IN his/PP$ face/NN ./.

The/AT pockets/NNS of/IN his/PP$ jacket/NN bulged/VBD ./.

The/AT bobbing/VBG head/NN was/BEDZ a/AT poor/JJ target/NN ,/, so/CS Matsuo/NP shot/VBD him/PPO in/IN the/AT upper/JJ trunk/NN ./.

The/AT marine/NN spun/VBD ,/, clapping/VBG a/AT hand/NN high/RB on/IN his/PP$ chest/NN ,/, and/CC dived/VBD forward/RB ./.

In/IN the/AT hush/NN that/WPS followed/VBD the/AT echoes/NNS ,/, Matsuo/NP was/BEDZ tense/JJ ./.

With/IN a/AT snakestrike/NN motion/NN he/PPS grasped/VBD the/AT hair/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, twisting/VBG ,/, pulled/VBD the/AT marine/NN over/RP on/IN his/PP$ back/NN ./.

Then/RB there/EX was/BEDZ no/AT saying/NN how/WRB many/AP times/NNS the/AT marine/NN had/HVD blown/VBN his/PP$ nose/NN on/IN the/AT handkerchief/NN ./.

Too/QL bad/JJ the/AT marine/NN had/HVD no/AT water/NN ./.

From/IN its/PP$ holder/NN he/PPS took/VBD his/PP$ own/JJ canteen/NN ./.

The/AT cap/NN was/BEDZ stuck/VBN and/CC made/VBD a/AT thin/JJ rusty/JJ squeaking/NN as/CS he/PPS applied/VBD pressure/NN ./.

The/AT marine/NN reached/VBD up/RP a/AT hand/NN ./.

``/`` You/PPSS came/VBD well/RB equipped/VBN to/TO die/VB ''/'' ./.

Drunk/JJ on/IN sake/NN ,/, he/PPS must/MD have/HV wandered/VBN off/RP from/IN his/PP$ bivouac/NN ./.

The/AT marine/NN tried/VBD to/TO roll/VB on/IN his/PP$ right/JJ side/NN ,/, and/CC moaned/VBD ./.

When/WRB he/PPS rolled/VBD on/IN the/AT left/JJ side/NN ,/, propping/VBG on/IN his/PP$ left/JJ elbow/NN ,/, Matsuo/NP seized/VBD his/PP$ hair/NN and/CC pulled/VBD him/PPO back/RB over/RP ./.

``/`` Be/BE a/AT good/JJ turtle/NN ''/'' ./.

Awkwardly/RB with/IN one/CD hand/NN Matsuo/NP got/VBD the/AT cap/NN back/RB on/IN the/AT water/NN bottle/NN ./.

The/AT smell/NN of/IN sake/NN had/HVD freshened/VBN yesterday's/NR$ events/NNS in/IN his/PP$ thoughts/NNS ./.

The/AT marine/NN shut/VBD his/PP$ eyes/NNS ./.

``/`` Are/BER you/PPSS a/AT thrower/NN of/IN flame/NN ,/, marine/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Matsuo/NP took/VBD the/AT small/JJ knife/NN from/IN its/PP$ scabbard/NN and/CC laid/VBD it/PPO on/IN the/AT ground/NN ,/, out/IN of/IN the/AT marine's/NN$ reach/NN and/CC away/RB from/IN their/PP$ shadows/NNS ./.

Every/AT so/QL often/RB he/PPS turned/VBD the/AT knife/NN ./.

At/IN last/RB he/PPS reached/VBD for/IN the/AT knife/NN ./.

Even/RB the/AT bone/NN handle/NN scorched/VBD ,/, and/CC he/PPS retrieved/VBD the/AT marine's/NN$ handkerchief/NN to/TO wrap/VB it/PPO ./.

The/AT marine/NN yelled/VBD and/CC flung/VBD the/AT hand/NN away/RB ./.

With/IN a/AT firm/JJ grip/NN on/IN the/AT man's/NN$ hair/NN Matsuo/NP applied/VBD the/AT blade/NN flat/RB on/IN a/AT cheek/NN ./.

A/AT shrill/JJ yelp/NN ,/, kicked/VBN legs/NNS ,/, and/CC groping/VBG hands/NNS that/WPS circled/VBD Matsuo's/NP$ wrist/NN ./.

Matsuo/NP wrenched/VBD free/JJ and/CC burned/VBD the/AT hands/NNS into/IN retreat/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT marine/NN commenced/VBD to/TO weep/VB and/CC it/PPS blighted/VBD the/AT sense/NN of/IN enjoyment/NN ./.

Matsuo/NP stood/VBD up/RP ./.

``/`` A/AT small/JJ measure/NN of/IN payment/NN ,/, marine/NN ''/'' ./.

As/CS Matsuo/NP climbed/VBD by/IN using/VBG the/AT vines/NNS and/CC kicking/VBG his/PP$ feet/NNS against/IN the/AT trunk/NN ,/, a/AT mood/NN of/IN gloom/NN immersed/VBD him/PPO like/CS a/AT jungle/NN shadow/NN ./.

In/IN the/AT jungle/NN ,/, birds/NNS were/BED mute/JJ ,/, while/CS insects/NNS preserved/VBD only/AP the/AT monotony/NN of/IN living/VBG ./.

The/AT man/NN tilted/VBD back/RB his/PP$ head/NN and/CC went/VBD through/IN the/AT pantomime/NN of/IN drinking/VBG from/IN a/AT container/NN ./.

``/`` Sake/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Matsuo/NP called/VBD ./.

The/AT marine/NN nodded/VBD vigorously/RB ./.

Matsuo/NP laughed/VBD ,/, slung/VBD the/AT rifle/NN ./.

The/AT marine/NN was/BEDZ a/AT winehead/NN ./.

His/PP$ superiors/NNS had/HVD said/VBN that/CS all/ABN marines/NNS were/BED depraved/VBN ./.

The/AT marine/NN slumped/VBD forward/RB into/IN a/AT bow/NN like/CS a/AT priest/NN before/IN an/AT idol/NN ./.

Remembering/VBG his/PP$ own/JJ thirst/NN ,/, Matsuo/NP took/VBD out/RP his/PP$ water/NN bottle/NN ./.

One/CD swallow/NN was/BEDZ all/ABN he/PPS would/MD have/HV ;/. ;/.

His/PP$ years/NNS of/IN campaigning/VBG had/HVD taught/VBN him/PPO the/AT value/NN of/IN water/NN discipline/NN ./.

He/PPS began/VBD to/TO uncap/VB the/AT bottle/NN ,/, the/AT rusty/JJ cap/NN squealing/VBG on/IN its/PP$ threads/NNS ./.

The/AT marine/NN shouted/VBD for/IN it/PPO until/CS it/PPS seemed/VBD that/CS his/PP$ voice/NN had/HVD to/TO crack/VB ./.

Matsuo/NP shook/VBD his/PP$ head/NN ./.

His/PP$ gun/NN was/BEDZ half/QL drawn/VBN when/WRB he/PPS asked/VBD the/AT question/NN ,/, but/CC the/AT weapon/NN never/RB left/VBD its/PP$ holster/NN ./.

Of/IN all/ABN the/AT rip-roaring/JJ two-fisted/JJ tough/JJ boys/NNS of/IN the/AT Old/JJ West/NR ,/, ``/`` Uncle/NN Billy/NP Tilghman/NP ''/'' stands/VBZ out/RP head/NN and/CC shoulders/NNS ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT lawman/NN who/WPS survived/VBD more/AP gunfights/NNS than/CS any/DTI other/AP famous/JJ gun-slinging/JJ character/NN in/IN the/AT book/NN ./.

For/IN fifty/CD years/NNS his/PP$ guns/NNS and/CC ham-like/JJ fists/NNS shot/VBD holes/NNS through/IN and/CC battered/VBD the/AT daylights/NNS out/IN of/IN the/AT enemies/NNS of/IN law/NN and/CC order/NN in/IN the/AT frontier/NN towns/NNS of/IN the/AT West/NR ./.

The/AT deeds/NNS of/IN countless/JJ western/JJ bandits/NNS and/CC outlaws/NNS have/HV been/BEN glorified/VBN almost/RB to/IN the/AT point/NN of/IN hero-worship/NN ,/, but/CC because/CS Billy/NP Tilghman/NP remained/VBD strictly/RB on/IN the/AT side/NN of/IN the/AT law/NN throughout/IN his/PP$ action-packed/JJ career/NN ,/, his/PP$ achievements/NNS and/CC the/AT appalling/JJ risks/NNS he/PPS took/VBD while/CS taming/VBG the/AT West/NR have/HV remained/VBN almost/RB unsung/JJ ./.

Citizens/NNS took/VBD the/AT view/NN that/CS a/AT lawman/NN was/BEDZ expected/VBN to/TO risk/VB his/PP$ life/NN on/IN the/AT odd/JJ occasion/NN anyway/RB ,/, but/CC this/DT fighting/VBG fury/NN of/IN a/AT man/NN risked/VBD it/PPO regularly/RB over/IN a/AT period/NN of/IN half/ABN a/AT century/NN ./.

He/PPS came/VBD within/IN an/AT ace/NN of/IN being/BEG riddled/VBN with/IN bullets/NNS during/IN his/PP$ long/JJ fight/NN with/IN the/AT Doolin/NP gang/NN which/WDT terrorized/VBD Oklahoma/NP in/IN the/AT 1890's/NNS ./.

Led/VBN by/IN Bill/NP Doolin/NP ,/, these/DTS mobsters/NNS specialized/VBD in/IN train/NN robberies/NNS but/CC as/IN a/AT sideline/NN they/PPSS looted/VBD stores/NNS and/CC robbed/VBD banks/NNS ,/, making/VBG liberal/JJ use/NN of/IN their/PP$ guns/NNS ./.

Bill/NP Doolin's/NP$ ambition/NN ,/, it/PPS appeared/VBD ,/, was/BEDZ to/TO carve/VB out/RP his/PP$ name/NN with/IN bullets/NNS alongside/IN those/DTS of/IN Jesse/NP James/NP and/CC Billy/NP the/AT Kid/NN ,/, and/CC Bill/NP Tilghman/NP had/HVD sworn/VBN he/PPS would/MD stop/VB him/PPO ./.

Tilghman/NP knew/VBD that/CS some/DTI ranchers/NNS were/BED hand-in-glove/JJ with/IN the/AT Doolin/NP gang/NN ./.

They/PPSS bought/VBD rustled/VBN cattle/NNS from/IN the/AT outlaw/NN ,/, kept/VBD him/PPO supplied/VBN with/IN guns/NNS and/CC ammunition/NN ,/, harbored/VBD his/PP$ men/NNS in/IN their/PP$ houses/NNS ./.

Billy/NP decided/VBD to/TO set/VB an/AT example/NN by/IN arresting/VBG one/CD of/IN the/AT ranchers/NNS ,/, named/VBN Ed/NP Dunn/NP ,/, who/WPS lived/VBD at/IN Rock/NN Fort/NN ./.

On/IN a/AT bitterly/RB cold/JJ day/NN in/IN January/NP ,/, 1895/CD ,/, accompanied/VBN only/RB by/IN Neal/NP Brown/NP as/CS his/PP$ deputy/NN ,/, Tilghman/NP left/VBD the/AT township/NN of/IN Guthrie/NP and/CC headed/VBD for/IN Rock/NN Fort/NN and/CC Dunn's/NP$ ranch/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ snowing/VBG hard/JJ when/WRB they/PPSS got/VBD there/RB and/CC they/PPSS saw/VBD no/AT horses/NNS outside/RB ./.

The/AT only/JJ evidence/NN of/IN occupation/NN came/VBD from/IN the/AT chimney/NN ,/, which/WDT was/BEDZ belching/VBG out/RP thick/JJ smoke/NN ./.

The/AT two/CD lawmen/NNS halted/VBD their/PP$ wagon/NN about/IN twenty/CD yards/NNS from/IN the/AT door/NN ./.

``/`` Wait/VB here/RB ,/, Neal/NP ''/'' ,/, said/VBD Tilghman/NP ./.

Leaving/VBG his/PP$ rifle/NN in/IN the/AT wagon/NN ,/, Tilghman/NP walked/VBD up/RP to/IN the/AT door/NN and/CC hammered/VBD on/IN it/PPO ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ no/AT reply/NN so/CS he/PPS shoved/VBD it/PPO open/JJ with/IN his/PP$ foot/NN and/CC stepped/VBD inside/RB ./.

Directly/RB opposite/IN the/AT door/NN was/BEDZ a/AT roaring/VBG log/NN fire/NN ,/, a/AT welcome/NN sight/NN on/IN that/DT bitterly/RB cold/JJ day/NN ./.

``/`` Hello/UH ,/, Ed/NP ''/'' ,/, said/VBD Tilghman/NP ./.

Tilghman/NP closed/VBD the/AT door/NN behind/IN him/PPO and/CC walked/VBD towards/IN the/AT fire/NN ./.

Suddenly/RB he/PPS saw/VBD something/PN which/WDT made/VBD his/PP$ big/JJ heart/NN give/VB a/AT sickening/VBG lurch/NN and/CC caused/VBD the/AT hairs/NNS to/TO bristle/VB on/IN the/AT back/NN of/IN his/PP$ neck/NN ./.

Along/IN each/DT side/NN of/IN the/AT room/NN were/BED six/CD tiered/JJ bunks/NNS ,/, each/DT one/CD screened/VBD off/RP with/IN a/AT curtain/NN ./.

And/CC projecting/VBG wickedly/RB through/IN these/DTS curtains/NNS were/BED the/AT gleaming/VBG muzzles/NNS of/IN six/CD rifles/NNS ,/, all/ABN trained/VBN on/IN Billy/NP Tilghman/NP ./.

The/AT fighting/VBG marshal/NN had/HVD walked/VBN right/QL into/IN a/AT trap/NN and/CC at/IN any/DTI moment/NN six/CD slugs/NNS might/MD slam/NN into/IN his/PP$ hide/NN ./.

Thinking/VBG fast/RB ,/, Tilghman/NP never/RB hesitated/VBD for/IN one/CD instant/NN ./.

He/PPS walked/VBD right/QL up/RP to/IN the/AT fire/NN as/CS though/CS blissfully/RB unaware/JJ of/IN the/AT guns/NNS covering/VBG him/PPO ./.

The/AT men/NNS behind/IN them/PPO were/BED Bill/NP Doolin/NP and/CC five/CD of/IN his/PP$ gang/NN --/-- every/AT man/NN a/AT killer/NN ./.

``/`` Cold/JJ day/NN ''/'' ,/, said/VBD Tilghman/NP ,/, placing/VBG his/PP$ hands/NNS behind/IN him/PPO and/CC casually/RB presenting/VBG his/PP$ backside/NN to/IN the/AT fire/NN ./.

``/`` Just/RB dropped/VBD in/RP to/TO ask/VB where/WRB Jed/NP Hawkins/NP lives/NNS ./.

Resisting/VBG the/AT overwhelming/JJ temptation/NN to/TO flng/VB himself/PPL out/IN of/IN that/DT bristling/VBG death-trap/NN ,/, Tilghman/NP deliberately/RB engaged/VBD the/AT nervous/JJ rancher/NN in/IN trivial/JJ conversation/NN for/IN a/AT good/JJ ten/CD minutes/NNS ./.

He/PPS strolled/VBD back/RB to/IN the/AT door/NN ,/, whistling/VBG softly/RB ,/, hands/NNS still/RB clasped/VBN behind/IN him/PPO ./.

He/PPS left/VBD the/AT house/NN and/CC almost/QL certain/JJ death/NN without/IN even/RB increasing/VBG his/PP$ pace/NN and/CC wondered/VBD by/IN what/WDT remarkable/JJ stroke/NN of/IN Providence/NP he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN allowed/VBN to/TO come/VB out/RP alive/JJ ./.

But/CC he/PPS knew/VBD well/RB enough/QLP that/CS those/DTS guns/NNS would/MD still/RB be/BE trained/VBN on/IN his/PP$ back/NN as/CS he/PPS walked/VBD towards/IN the/AT wagon/NN ./.

``/`` Don't/DO* say/VB or/CC do/DO anything/PN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD softly/RB ./.

The/AT children/NNS grudgingly/RB stopped/VBD playing/VBG then/RB and/CC straggled/VBD into/IN the/AT schoolhouse/NN ./.

Jack/NP walked/VBD off/RP alone/RB out/IN the/AT road/NN in/IN the/AT searing/VBG midday/NN sun/NN ,/, past/IN Robert/NP Allen's/NP$ three-room/JJ ,/, tarpapered/VBN house/NN ,/, toward/IN the/AT field/NN where/WRB the/AT other/AP boys/NNS were/BED playing/VBG ball/NN ,/, thinking/VBG of/IN what/WDT he/PPS would/MD do/DO in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB Miss/NP Langford/NP have/HV him/PPO stay/VB in/RP after/IN school/NN --/-- because/CS this/DT was/BEDZ the/AT day/NN he/PPS had/HVD decided/VBN when/WRB he/PPS thought/VBD he/PPS saw/VBD the/AT look/NN in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS ./.

``/`` Dandy/NP is/BEZ to/TO be/BE our/PP$ house/NN guest/NN ,/, Louis/NP ./.

``/`` Quite/QL so/RB ,/, my/PP$ dear/NN ./.

The/AT physician/NN led/VBD the/AT horses/NNS to/IN the/AT stable/NN after/CS a/AT cursory/JJ glance/NN at/IN the/AT cringing/VBG slave/NN ./.

Had/HVD Dandy/NP been/BEN older/JJR or/CC wiser/JJR ,/, instinct/NN might/MD have/HV warned/VBN him/PPO that/CS he/PPS would/MD be/BE well/RB advised/VBN to/TO flee/VB from/IN the/AT Lalauries'/NPS$ tender/JJ care/NN if/CS he/PPS valued/VBD his/PP$ life/NN ./.

So/CS Dandy/NP Brandon/NP trustingly/RB entered/VBD the/AT house/NN with/IN Delphine/NP Lalaurie/NP and/CC trudged/VBD up/IN the/AT rear/JJ steps/NNS to/IN the/AT attic/NN room/NN which/WDT was/BEDZ to/TO be/BE his/PP$ new/JJ home/NR ./.

Airless/JJ and/CC dingy/JJ though/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, the/AT attic/NN represented/VBD luxury/NN to/IN a/AT slave/NN who/WPS had/HVD led/VBN a/AT wretched/JJ life/NN with/IN six/CD brothers/NNS and/CC sisters/NNS and/CC assorted/VBN relatives/NNS in/IN a/AT shanty/NN at/IN Bayou/NP St./NN John/NP ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ just/RB as/QL well/RB that/CS the/AT ignorant/JJ Dandy/NP enjoyed/VBD himself/PPL to/IN the/AT hilt/NN that/DT first/OD evening/NN ,/, for/CS the/AT room/NN was/BEDZ to/TO become/VB his/PP$ prison/NN cell/NN ./.

Just/RB six/CD weeks/NNS after/IN Dandy/NP Brandon's/NP$ arrival/NN at/IN the/AT mansion/NN ,/, the/AT little/JJ surgeon/NN and/CC his/PP$ svelte/JJ young/JJ wife/NN gave/VBD their/PP$ annual/JJ open/JJ house/NN and/CC ball/NN ,/, to/IN which/WDT only/RB New/JJ Orleans'/NP$ oldest/JJT and/CC wealthiest/JJT families/NNS were/BED invited/VBN ./.

A/AT stringed/VBN orchestra/NN played/VBD softly/RB behind/IN the/AT potted/VBN palms/NNS ,/, and/CC Delphine/NP circulated/VBD graciously/RB among/IN her/PPO guests/NNS ,/, chatting/VBG airily/RB of/IN the/AT forthcoming/JJ races/NNS ,/, the/AT latest/JJT fashions/NNS from/IN Paris/NP ,/, and/CC Louisiana/NP politics/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ Dandy/NP Brandon/NP ,/, clad/VBN only/RB in/IN a/AT bloody/JJ loincloth/NN ,/, emaciated/VBN and/CC quaking/VBG as/CS if/CS the/AT devil/NN were/BED breathing/VBG hard/JJ on/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` I/PPSS saw/VBD the/AT boy/NN Dandy/NP at/IN the/AT Congo/NP Square/NN festivities/NNS and/CC felt/VBD sorry/JJ for/IN him/PPO ./.

After/CS I/PPSS paid/VBD Monsieur/NP Prieur/NP for/IN Dandy/NP ,/, I/PPSS brought/VBD him/PPO home/NR ,/, but/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ ill/JJ at/IN ease/NN and/CC ran/VBD away/RB the/AT same/AP night/NN ./.

Though/CS the/AT slave's/NN$ dying/VBG words/NNS about/IN the/AT woman/NN troubled/VBN the/AT coroner's/NN$ panel/NN ,/, Dandy's/NP$ accusation/NN was/BEDZ adjudged/VBN an/AT aberration/NN by/IN the/AT jury/NN and/CC disregarded/VBD ./.

The/AT Old/JJ Man/NN near/IN the/AT corner/NN let/VBD the/AT shadow/NN pass/NN over/IN him/PPO ,/, sensing/VBG something/PN portentous/JJ in/IN it/PPO ./.

The/AT clapping/NN they/PPSS made/VBD on/IN the/AT concrete/NN interrupted/VBD him/PPO in/IN the/AT ecstatic/JJ pleasure/NN he/PPS knew/VBD ,/, so/CS that/CS he/PPS quickly/RB released/VBD his/PP$ hold/NN on/IN the/AT goat/NN and/CC pretended/VBD to/TO be/BE examining/VBG its/PP$ haunches/NNS for/IN ticks/NNS ./.

Back/RB in/IN her/PP$ living/VBG quarters/NNS at/IN the/AT hospital/NN she/PPS took/VBD bicarbonate/NN of/IN soda/NN ,/, and/CC sulked/VBD ./.

Then/RB ,/, after/IN a/AT while/NN ,/, she/PPS went/VBD to/IN her/PP$ mirror/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ all/QL true/JJ ./.

She/PPS certainly/RB looked/VBD Japanese/JJ ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB she/PPS could/MD not/* really/RB blame/VB the/AT young/JJ men/NNS ./.

And/CC ,/, still/RB ,/, they/PPSS did/DOD not/* have/HV to/TO be/BE so/QL crude/JJ in/IN their/PP$ approach/NN ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT letter/NN to/TO write/VB to/IN her/PP$ mother/NN ,/, and/CC she/PPS tried/VBD to/TO make/VB its/PP$ tone/NN cheerful/JJ ./.

She/PPS promised/VBD that/CS she/PPS would/MD soon/RB take/VB a/AT few/AP day's/NN$ leave/NN and/CC visit/VB the/AT uncle/NN she/PPS had/HVD never/RB seen/VBN ,/, on/IN the/AT island/NN of/IN Oyajima/NP --/-- which/WDT was/BEDZ not/* very/QL far/RB from/IN Yokosuka/NP ./.

Actually/RB ,/, this/DT is/BEZ only/RB another/DT way/NN of/IN saying/VBG that/CS blood/NN is/BEZ thicker/JJR than/CS water/NN ./.

Doc/NP Doolittle's/NP$ scheduled/VBN appearance/NN at/IN captain's/NN$ mast/NN was/BEDZ a/AT very/QL unusual/JJ thing/NN ,/, because/CS the/AT discipline/NN dispensed/VBN there/RB is/BEZ ordinarily/RB for/IN the/AT young/JJ and/CC immature/JJ ,/, and/CC a/AT chief/NN is/BEZ naturally/RB expected/VBN to/TO stay/VB off/IN the/AT report/NN ./.

But/CC the/AT beer/NN hall/NN riot/NN in/IN Subic/NP had/HVD been/BEN unusual/JJ ,/, too/RB ,/, and/CC Walt/NP Perry/NP was/BEDZ convinced/VBN that/CS Doc/NP had/HVD started/VBN it/PPO through/IN some/DTI expert/JJ tactics/NNS in/IN rabble/NN rousing/VBG ./.

Just/RB why/WRB anybody/PN should/MD wish/VB to/TO start/VB a/AT riot/NN the/AT executive/NN officer/NN didn't/DOD* know/VB ./.

In/IN his/PP$ opinion/NN ,/, Doc/NP had/HVD not/* grown/VBN up/RP ./.

The/AT lieutenant/NN was/BEDZ not/* entirely/QL wrong/JJ in/IN the/AT belief/NN ./.

There/EX had/HVD never/RB been/BEN a/AT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN Doc/NP Doolittle/NP to/TO grow/VB up/RP ./.

He/PPS had/HVD come/VBN into/IN the/AT Navy/NN too/QL young/JJ ,/, with/IN the/AT image/NN of/IN the/AT fun-loving/JJ Guns/NNS Appleby/NP before/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT war/NN found/VBD him/PPO much/QL too/QL early/RB ,/, and/CC its/PP$ perils/NNS --/-- and/CC especially/RB its/PP$ awful/JJ boredom/NN --/-- were/BED best/RBT forgotten/VBN in/IN horseplay/NN and/CC elaborate/JJ practical/JJ jokes/NNS ,/, and/CC even/QL now/RB Doc/NP had/HVD never/RB found/VBN any/DTI stabilizing/VBG ,/, sobering/VBG influence/NN ./.

He/PPS wisecracked/VBD about/IN the/AT captain's/NN$ indoctrination/NN of/IN new/JJ men/NNS ,/, took/VBD great/JJ delight/NN in/IN slaughtering/VBG cockroaches/NNS with/IN ethyl/NN chloride/NN ,/, and/CC gave/VBD no/AT thought/NN for/IN tomorrow/NR ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ doing/VBG thirty/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC the/AT Navy/NN would/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN him/PPO ./.

The/AT job/NN security/NN enjoyed/VBN by/IN Doc/NP Doolittle/NP ,/, and/CC nearly/RB all/ABN members/NNS of/IN the/AT Armed/VBN Forces/NNS ,/, is/BEZ a/AT wonderful/JJ thing/NN ./.

Actually/RB ,/, all/ABN a/AT man/NN in/IN uniform/NN has/HVZ to/TO do/DO is/BEZ to/TO get/VB by/RB ./.

He/PPS may/MD not/* rise/VB to/IN the/AT heights/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PPS can/MD get/VB by/RB ,/, and/CC eventually/RB be/BE retired/VBN ./.

Doc/NP had/HVD been/BEN under/IN restriction/NN to/IN the/AT ship/NN since/CS the/AT Bustard/NP left/VBD Subic/NP ./.

This/DT deprived/VBD him/PPO of/IN liberty/NN in/IN Hong/NP Kong/NP ,/, but/CC he/PPS told/VBD Boats/NP McCafferty/NP that/CS Hong/NP Kong/NP was/BEDZ a/AT book/NN he/PPS had/HVD read/VBN before/RB ,/, and/CC the/AT Navy/NN would/MD always/RB bring/VB him/PPO there/RB again/RB ,/, some/DTI day/NN ./.

At/IN Yokosuka/NP he/PPS was/BEDZ restricted/VBN to/IN the/AT confines/NNS of/IN the/AT Base/NN because/CS Walt/NP Perry/NP ,/, being/BEG thoughtful/JJ ,/, knew/VBD that/CS Doc/NP might/MD have/HV to/TO draw/VB some/DTI medical/JJ supplies/NNS from/IN the/AT hospital/NN or/CC the/AT Supply/NN Base/NN ./.

This/DT gave/VBD Doc/NP the/AT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN the/AT naval/JJ establishment/NN ,/, and/CC suited/VBD him/PPO quite/QL well/RB ./.

There/EX were/BED two/CD things/NNS he/PPS wanted/VBD to/TO do/DO :/: inspect/VB one/CD of/IN the/AT many/AP caves/NNS that/WPS had/HVD been/BEN dug/VBN into/IN the/AT hills/NNS on/IN the/AT Naval/JJ Base/NN ,/, and/CC visit/VB an/AT old/JJ shipmate/NN ./.

A/AT telephone/NN line/NN had/HVD been/BEN hooked/VBN up/RP to/TO connect/VB the/AT ship/NN with/IN the/AT Base/NN exchange/NN ./.

After/IN supper/NN ,/, Doc/NP called/VBD Whitey/NP Gresham/NP ,/, who/WPS was/BEDZ now/RB a/AT lieutenant/NN and/CC had/HVD a/AT family/NN ./.

``/`` Well/UH ,/, Doc/NP ,/, you/PPSS old/JJ sonofabitch/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

``/`` Spencer/NP ,/, if/CS there/EX is/BEZ guilt/NN ,/, if/CS you/PPSS do/DO not/* deny/VB your/PP$ own/JJ ,/, how/WRB is/BEZ it/PPS possible/JJ for/IN Cromwell/NP to/TO be/BE innocent/JJ ?/. ?/.

``/`` I/PPSS am/BEM innocent/JJ ,/, Captain/NN ''/'' ,/, Cromwell/NP said/VBD again/RB ./.

The/AT boatswain/NN was/BEDZ as/QL guilty/JJ as/CS any/DTI ./.

No/AT action/NN of/IN his/PP$$ could/MD be/BE interpreted/VBN in/IN his/PP$ favor/NN and/CC four/CD midshipmen/NNS ,/, prior/RB to/IN their/PP$ knowing/VBG the/AT significance/NN of/IN the/AT Greek/JJ paper/NN ,/, had/HVD seen/VBN it/PPO in/IN Cromwell's/NP$ hands/NNS while/CS Spencer/NP whispered/VBD explanations/NNS ./.

A/AT young/JJ man/NN appeared/VBD out/IN of/IN a/AT side/NN alley/NN and/CC walked/VBD toward/IN us/PPO with/IN quick/JJ strides/NNS ./.

His/PP$ black/JJ hat/NN with/IN its/PP$ wide/JJ brim/NN ,/, high/JJ crown/NN ,/, and/CC fur/NN trim/NN rode/VBD high/RB ./.

Little/JJ boys/NNS crowded/VBD together/RB on/IN long/JJ wooden/JJ benches/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN the/AT center/NN of/IN the/AT room/NN sat/VBD the/AT teacher/NN ./.

I/PPSS could/MD not/* keep/VB my/PP$ eyes/NNS away/RB from/IN the/AT boy/NN with/IN the/AT red/JJ hair/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT place/NN full/JJ of/IN courage/NN and/CC hope/NN and/CC you/PPSS were/BED part/NN of/IN it/PPO ./.

The/AT two/CD little/JJ bangs/NNS meant/VBD that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ getting/VBG impatient/JJ to/TO have/HV a/AT crowd/NN of/IN customers/NNS waited/VBD on/RP and/CC that/CS if/CS he/PPS had/HVD to/IN he/PPS would/MD jerk/VB open/VB the/AT door/NN and/CC drag/VB out/RP ,/, by/IN the/AT opposite/JJ door/NN handle/NN which/WDT she/PPS would/MD be/BE clutching/VBG ,/, whichever-the-hell/WDT clerk/NN it/PPS was/BEDZ who/WPS thought/VBD she/PPS could/MD waste/VB so/QL much/AP store/NN time/NN on/IN the/AT pot/NN ./.

Each/DT of/IN us/PPO had/HVN his/PP$ own/JJ specialty/NN besides/RB ./.

``/`` That's/DT+BEZ authenticity/NN ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ./.

We/PPSS used/VBD to/TO kid/VB him/PPO by/IN saying/VBG he/PPS only/RB painted/VBD that/DT way/NN because/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ so/QL nearsighted/JJ ./.

It/PPS may/MD have/HV been/BEN true/JJ for/IN all/ABN I/PPSS know/VB ,/, because/CS his/PP$ glasses/NNS were/BED like/CS the/AT bottoms/NNS of/IN milk/NN bottles/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PPS didn't/DOD* prevent/VB the/AT paintings/NNS from/IN being/BEG exciting/JJ ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ fifteen/CD years/NNS older/JJR than/CS I/PPSS --/-- forty-four/CD --/-- but/CC full/JJ of/IN spring/NN and/CC sparkle/NN ./.

At/IN the/AT same/AP time/NN that/CS I/PPSS thought/VBD I/PPSS understood/VBD her/PPO at/IN long/JJ last/AP and/CC pitied/VBD her/PPO ,/, underneath/IN this/DT knowing/VBG had/HVD there/EX burned/VBN unquenched/JJ by/IN my/PP$ pity/NN a/AT fire/NN of/IN hate/NN ,/, an/AT enduring/VBG envy/NN that/CS burst/VBD out/RP in/IN that/DT ghastly/JJ outcry/NN ?/. ?/.

Even/RB now/RB I/PPSS am/BEM appalled/VBN at/IN how/WRB little/AP anyone/PN knows/VBZ of/IN what/WDT they/PPSS really/RB are/BER ./.

It/PPS is/BEZ absurd/JJ of/IN course/NN to/TO say/VB that/CS that/DT one/CD exclamation/NN estranged/VBD me/PPO from/IN the/AT family/NN I/PPSS considered/VBD my/PP$ very/QL own/JJ ,/, but/CC there/RB it/PPS hangs/VBZ ,/, a/AT cooling/VBG void/NN that/WPS broke/VBD our/PP$ close/JJ connection/NN with/IN each/DT other/AP ./.

At/IN the/AT time/NN I/PPSS was/BEDZ filled/VBN with/IN self-pity/NN at/IN this/DT separation/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN the/AT years/NNS since/IN I/PPSS have/HV come/VBN to/TO understand/VB that/CS the/AT sight/NN of/IN me/PPO was/BEDZ painful/JJ to/IN them/PPO after/IN that/DT outcry/NN ./.

``/`` We/PPSS all/ABN feel/VB guilty/JJ ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS turned/VBD away/RB from/IN her/PPO coldly/RB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ coarse/JJ ,/, almost/RB insulting/JJ ,/, this/DT harsh/JJ appraisal/NN ,/, and/CC she/PPS has/HVZ never/RB come/VBN to/TO see/VB me/PPO since/IN ./.

If/CS they/PPSS say/VB I/PPSS could/MD have/HV stopped/VBN her/PPO it/PPS is/BEZ because/CS they/PPSS are/BER ignorant/JJ of/IN her/PP$ last/AP weeks/NNS of/IN self-examination/NN ,/, her/PP$ search/NN into/IN herself/PPL and/CC its/PP$ conclusions/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PPSS am/BEM what/WDT I/PPSS am/BEM ./.

He/PPS didn't/DOD* know/VB how/WRB she/PPS would/MD behave/VB with/IN other/AP people/NNS ./.

When/WRB they/PPSS walked/VBD into/IN the/AT Ferraro/NP apartment/NN ,/, the/AT old/JJ lady/NN ,/, bowing/VBG and/CC smiling/VBG ,/, said/VBD softly/RB ./.

``/`` Ciao/UH ,/, ''/'' and/CC put/VBD out/RP her/PP$ hand/NN ./.

And/CC they/PPSS sat/VBD down/RP and/CC began/VBD their/PP$ little/JJ coffee/NN party/NN ./.

The/AT Ferraros/NPS offered/VBD them/PPO biscuits/NNS with/IN the/AT coffee/NN ./.

Acting/VBG only/RB as/CS interpreter/NN Carla/NP ,/, her/PP$ hands/NNS folded/VBN on/IN her/PP$ lap/NN ,/, was/BEDZ utterly/RB impersonal/JJ ./.

She/PPS would/MD turn/VB to/IN them/PPO ,/, then/RB turn/VB to/IN him/PPO ,/, then/RB turn/VB again/RB ./.

She/PPS wanted/VBD to/TO know/VB ./.

Regretfully/RB Sam/NP explained/VBD that/CS he/PPS had/HVD no/AT experience/NN with/IN boxcars/NNS ./.

Just/RB the/AT same/AP ,/, the/AT old/JJ woman/NN said/VBD ,/, she/PPS would/MD write/VB to/IN her/PP$ nephew/NN in/IN his/PP$ boxcar/NN and/CC tell/VB him/PPO she/PPS had/HVD met/VBN a/AT nice/JJ man/NN from/IN his/PP$ adopted/VBN country/NN ./.

A/AT very/QL great/JJ Pope/NN ,/, this/DT one/PN ,/, the/AT old/JJ woman/NN explained/VBD ,/, her/PP$ black/JJ eyes/NNS sparkling/VBG ./.

An/AT intellectual/NN ./.

But/CC very/QL mystical/JJ too/RB ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ said/VBN that/CS he/PPS had/HVD had/HVN a/AT vision/NN ./.

Now/RB a/AT little/JJ flush/NN came/VBD on/IN her/PP$ pale/JJ homely/JJ face/NN and/CC enchantment/NN in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS ./.

The/AT Holy/JJ Father/NN would/MD die/VB soon/RB ,/, she/PPS said/VBD to/IN Carla/NP ,/, so/CS she/PPS could/MD translate/VB for/IN Sam/NP ,/, although/CS he/PPS had/HVD a/AT brilliant/JJ doctor/NN ,/, a/AT man/NN who/WPS did/DOD not/* need/VB the/AT assistance/NN of/IN those/DTS doctors/NNS offered/VBN by/IN the/AT great/JJ rulers/NNS of/IN the/AT world/NN ./.

No/RB ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ indeed/RB a/AT saint/NN now/RB ./.

Nodding/VBG approvingly/RB and/CC swelling/VBG with/IN importance/NN ,/, the/AT old/JJ lady/NN whispered/VBD confidentially/RB ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ a/AT certain/JJ discontent/NN among/IN the/AT cardinals/NNS ./.

The/AT Pope/NN ,/, in/IN the/AT splendor/NN of/IN his/PP$ great/JJ intellect/NN ,/, had/HVD neglected/VBN them/PPO a/AT little/AP ./.

There/EX would/MD be/BE changes/NNS made/VBN ,/, and/CC Signor/NP Raymond/NP should/MD understand/VB that/CS when/WRB the/AT Pope/NN died/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ like/CS the/AT end/NN of/IN a/AT regime/NN in/IN Rome/NP ./.

Did/DOD Signor/NP Raymond/NP understand/VB ?/. ?/.

Indeed/RB he/PPS did/DOD ,/, Sam/NP said/VBD solemnly/RB ,/, trying/VBG to/TO get/VB Carla's/NP$ eye/NN ./.

Devout/JJ ,/, orthodox/JJ and/CC plain/JJ like/CS a/AT family/NN she/PPS might/MD meet/VB in/IN Brooklyn/NP or/CC Malta/NP or/CC Ireland/NP ./.

But/CC Carla's/NP$ eyes/NNS were/BED on/IN Agnese/NP whose/WP$ glowing/VBG face/NN and/CC softening/VBG eyes/NNS gave/VBD her/PPO a/AT look/NN of/IN warmth/NN and/CC happiness/NN ./.

``/`` It/PPS means/VBZ so/QL much/AP to/IN her/PPO ./.

It's/PPS+BEZ like/CS a/AT flame/NN ,/, I/PPSS guess/VB ''/'' ,/, she/PPS said/VBD in/IN a/AT dreamy/JJ tone/NN ./.

With/IN the/AT blue/JJ flesh/NN of/IN night/NN touching/VBG him/PPO he/PPS stood/VBD under/IN a/AT gentle/JJ hill/NN caressing/VBG the/AT flageolet/NN with/IN his/PP$ lips/NNS ,/, making/VBG it/PPO whisper/VB ./.

Seeing/VBG her/PPO come/VB ,/, he/PPS caught/VBD his/PP$ breath/NN ,/, feeling/VBG his/PP$ heart/NN bounce/VB in/IN him/PPO ,/, and/CC turned/VBD away/RB ,/, afraid/JJ now/RB ./.

Even/RB he/PPS ,/, wanting/VBG her/PPO ,/, afraid/JJ of/IN her/PPO and/CC not/* knowing/VBG how/WRB to/TO press/VB his/PP$ suit/NN ,/, feared/VBD the/AT evil/JJ presences/NNS in/IN her/PP$ metabolism/NN more/RBR ./.

His/PP$ breath/NN caught/VBD ,/, and/CC ,/, trembling/VBG ,/, he/PPS closed/VBD his/PP$ eyes/NNS and/CC stumbled/VBD off/RP ./.

Going/VBG ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD as/CS often/RB before/RB some/DTI queer/JJ ,/, hideous/JJ yellow/JJ face/NN over/IN his/PP$ head/NN ,/, shining/VBG and/CC weird/JJ like/CS the/AT old/JJ images/NNS which/WDT had/HVD invested/VBN him/PPO at/IN other/AP times/NNS like/VB those/DTS that/WPS appear/VB sometimes/RB near/IN the/AT eyeballs/NNS when/WRB they/PPSS are/BER perhaps/RB pressed/VBN by/IN the/AT thumbs/NNS ./.

Elsewhere/NN others/NNS heard/VBN and/CC stopped/VBD and/CC waited/VBD ,/, the/AT women/NNS peering/VBG from/IN their/PP$ lodges/NNS then/RB gathering/VBG in/IN small/JJ ,/, curious/JJ clusters/NNS ./.

Early/JJ Spring/NN came/VBD from/IN her/PP$ bed/NN ,/, from/IN beside/IN her/PPO half-drunk/JJ husband/NN ,/, Walitzee/NP ,/, and/CC stood/VBD at/IN the/AT entrance/NN way/NN to/IN her/PP$ lodge/NN hearing/VBG the/AT mild/JJ commotion/NN ,/, the/AT sound/NN of/IN hushed/VBN voices/NNS ./.

Standing/VBG there/RB she/PPS saw/VBD Shades/NNS of/IN Night/NN come/VB through/IN the/AT trees/NNS and/CC stop/VB beside/IN the/AT lodge/NN ,/, silent/JJ ,/, almost/RB imperious/JJ ,/, her/PP$ body/NN taut/JJ ,/, simply/RB standing/VBG without/IN speaking/VBG or/CC moving/VBG while/CS the/AT wife/NN of/IN Walitzee/NP waited/VBD ,/, perhaps/RB denying/VBG the/AT dread/NN that/WPS moved/VBD in/IN her/PPO ./.

He/PPS ranted/VBD and/CC prophesied/VBD the/AT doom/NN of/IN his/PP$ enemies/NNS ,/, walking/VBG in/IN circles/NNS in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN his/PP$ living/VBG place/NN ,/, drinking/VBG stolen/VBN whisky/NN in/IN great/JJ ,/, gasping/VBG draughts/NNS until/CS finally/RB ,/, incoherent/JJ and/CC sick/JJ ,/, he/PPS fell/VBD into/IN his/PP$ own/JJ oblivion/NN ./.

He/PPS amused/VBD the/AT young/JJ men/NNS who/WPS had/HVD been/BEN silent/JJ long/RB enough/QLP ./.

But/CC they/PPSS could/MD taste/VB the/AT appeasement/NN of/IN violence/NN and/CC retribution/NN through/IN his/PP$ antics/NNS ./.

Now/RB they/PPSS moved/VBD ,/, rubbing/VBG their/PP$ flesh/NN alive/JJ again/RB ,/, disdaining/VBG the/AT gloom/NN they/PPSS saw/VBD in/IN the/AT faces/NNS around/IN them/PPO ./.

They/PPSS came/VBD out/RP and/CC held/VBD their/PP$ games/NNS and/CC races/NNS ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ they/PPSS who/WPS held/VBD the/AT future/NN in/IN their/PP$ hands/NNS ./.

They/PPSS went/VBD into/IN the/AT sun/NN together/RB and/CC paraded/VBD grandly/RB in/IN their/PP$ war/NN clothes/NNS ,/, painting/VBG their/PP$ faces/NNS with/IN the/AT sacred/JJ attis/NN dug/VBN far/RB off/RP in/IN the/AT cave/NN of/IN skeletons/NNS ./.

They/PPSS danced/VBD the/AT paxam/NN wildly/RB at/IN night/NN ,/, the/AT war/NN dance/NN ,/, and/CC dipped/VBD their/PP$ arrowheads/NNS in/IN the/AT venom/NN of/IN rattlesnakes/NNS and/CC rode/VBD their/PP$ horses/NNS in/IN swift/JJ maneuvers/NNS ,/, firing/VBG their/PP$ few/AP guns/NNS in/IN unison/NN at/IN some/DTI indeterminate/JJ signal/NN ./.

Walitzee/NP was/BEDZ among/IN them/PPO ,/, and/CC Sarpsis/NP ,/, and/CC they/PPSS wore/VBD red/JJ blankets/NNS which/WDT flew/VBD like/CS broad/JJ wings/NNS in/IN the/AT air/NN of/IN their/PP$ passing/NN ./.

And/CC a/AT very/QL young/JJ one/PN ,/, Swan/NN Necklace/NN ,/, tried/VBD to/TO emulate/VB them/PPO and/CC followed/VBD timidly/RB ./.

All/QL the/AT young/JJ men/NNS ,/, Alokut/NP among/IN them/PPO ,/, challenged/VBD them/PPO in/IN matched/VBN racing/NN ./.

They/PPSS raced/VBD and/CC maneuvered/VBD for/IN war/NN ,/, swinging/VBG their/PP$ horses/NNS in/IN single/AP file/NN and/CC then/RB abreast/RB like/CS cavalry/NN ./.

At/IN times/NNS they/PPSS would/MD ride/VB frenziedly/RB through/IN the/AT camp/NN ,/, letting/VBG the/AT women/NNS see/VB their/PP$ courage/NN ,/, how/WRB handsome/JJ they/PPSS were/BED in/IN their/PP$ regalia/NNS ./.

Then/RB again/RB they/PPSS would/MD stand/VB in/IN circles/NNS making/VBG other/AP preparations/NNS ./.

They/PPSS combed/VBD their/PP$ hair/NN and/CC streaked/VBD it/PPO at/IN the/AT part/NN and/CC greased/VBD the/AT bangs/NNS so/CS that/CS the/AT hair/NN above/IN their/PP$ foreheads/NNS stood/VBD rigid/JJ like/CS the/AT tails/NNS of/IN sage/NN hens/NNS making/VBG love/NN ./.

Walitzee/NP whitened/VBD his/PP$ leggings/NNS with/IN clay/NN ,/, knowing/VBG the/AT girl/NN watched/VBD from/IN her/PP$ place/NN in/IN the/AT trees/NNS ./.

He/PPS saw/VBD himself/PPL in/IN a/AT superior/JJ reflection/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ as/CS a/AT speeding/VBG arrow/NN from/IN the/AT taut/JJ bow/NN ,/, hurtling/VBG with/IN a/AT mad/JJ grace/NN ,/, his/PP$ maleness/NN shining/VBG and/CC scented/VBN with/IN meadow/NN rue/NN ./.

And/CC the/AT suspicious/JJ ,/, envenomed/VBN eyes/NNS of/IN Pile/NN of/IN Clouds/NNS ./.

And/CC those/DTS of/IN Early/JJ Spring/NN ,/, haunted/VBN and/CC now/RB full/JJ of/IN hurt/NN and/CC envy/NN ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD so/QL much/RB like/CS laughing/VBG ;/. ;/.

And/CC so/CS the/AT sun/NN came/VBD up/RP again/RB and/CC for/IN a/AT moment/NN its/PP$ color/NN was/BEDZ the/AT young/JJ men's/NNS$ blood/NN ,/, shifting/VBG then/RB into/IN the/AT full/JJ heat/NN and/CC outcry/NN which/WDT ran/VBD with/IN their/PP$ hearts/NNS ./.

They/PPSS mounted/VBD their/PP$ horses/NNS and/CC rode/VBD off/RP into/IN the/AT hills/NNS ./.

The/AT ,/,

young/JJ chief/NN stared/VBD at/IN the/AT wall/NN of/IN his/PP$ lodge/NN ,/, ,/, listening/VBG ./.

The/AT sound/NN rose/VBD on/IN the/AT other/AP side/NN of/IN the/AT hills/NNS ,/, vanished/VBD and/CC rose/VBD again/RB and/CC he/PPS could/MD imagine/VB the/AT mad/JJ ,/, disheveled/VBN hoofs/NNS of/IN the/AT Appaloosas/NPS ,/, horses/NNS the/AT white/JJ men/NNS once/RB had/HVD called/VBN the/AT Dogs/NNS of/IN Hell/NN ./.

He/PPS saw/VBD them/PPO in/IN fleet/JJ images/NNS as/CS they/PPSS came/VBD rolling/VBG and/CC now/RB burst/VBD across/IN the/AT ridge/NN ./.

Standing/VBG then/RB with/IN the/AT others/NNS ,/, peering/VBG into/IN the/AT sun/NN ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD the/AT bright/JJ ,/, multicolored/JJ legion/NN ,/, their/PP$ hair/NN flying/VBG like/CS dark/JJ banners/NNS ,/, only/RB the/AT thunder/NN ,/, the/AT roll/NN of/IN drums/NNS ,/, the/AT mad/JJ cacophony/NN of/IN the/AT hoofs/NNS accompanying/VBG them/PPO ./.

They/PPSS leaned/VBD into/IN the/AT wind/NN and/CC seemed/VBD like/CS one/CD thousand-legged/JJ monster/NN hurtling/VBG and/CC plunging/VBG until/CS suddenly/RB they/PPSS rose/VBD straight/RB in/IN their/PP$ saddles/NNS and/CC in/IN one/CD terrifying/VBG voice/NN shouted/VBD ,/, ejaculated/VBD their/PP$ grotesque/JJ cry/NN of/IN war/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ moving/VBG through/IN a/AT screen/NN of/IN hemlocks/NNS ,/, in/RP among/IN the/AT white/JJ birch/NN and/CC maples/NNS ./.

The/AT sounds/NNS from/IN the/AT quarry/NN began/VBD to/TO pulse/VB in/IN her/PP$ ears/NNS ./.

She/PPS stood/VBD ,/, once/RB more/RBR listening/VBG ./.

She/PPS had/HVD never/RB been/BEN here/RB at/IN this/DT hour/NN ./.

She/PPS felt/VBD as/CS if/CS some/DTI dark/JJ ,/, totally/RB unfamiliar/JJ shape/NN would/MD clutch/VB at/IN her/PP$ arm/NN ;/. ;/.

If/CS I/PPSS ever/RB committed/VBD suicide/NN ,/, she/PPS thought/VBD ,/, I/PPSS would/MD dive/VB straight/RB down/RP from/IN here/RB --/-- and/CC no/AT one/PN would/MD find/VB me/PPO for/IN days/NNS ./.

She/PPS smiled/VBD ,/, and/CC expertly/RB let/VBD herself/PPL downward/RB ,/, holding/VBG this/DT known/VBN root/NN or/CC that/DT ,/, her/PP$ sneakers/NNS sliding/VBG in/IN the/AT leaves/NNS ./.

She/PPS jumped/VBD out/RP onto/IN the/AT flat/JJ expanse/NN of/IN rock/NN and/CC ,/, seating/VBG herself/PPL ,/, shook/VBD her/PPO short-cut/JJ brown/JJ hair/NN and/CC tilted/VBD her/PP$ chin/NN far/QL upward/RB ./.

The/AT reedy/JJ music/NN of/IN the/AT frogs/NNS had/HVD faded/VBN ,/, but/CC presently/RB it/PPS began/VBD again/RB ,/, growing/VBG in/IN volume/NN until/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ vibrant/JJ ./.

Julia/NP felt/VBD at/IN peace/NN and/CC drew/VBD her/PPO legs/NNS up/RP and/CC clasped/VBD her/PP$ hands/NNS tightly/RB around/IN the/AT bent/VBN knees/NNS ./.

She/PPS had/HVD accomplished/VBN a/AT miracle/NN ./.

This/DT was/BEDZ her/PP$ place/NN ./.

The/AT hour/NN couldn't/MD* change/VB it/PPO ./.

Only/RB --/-- only/RB --/-- her/PP$ thoughts/NNS were/BED a/AT little/QL strange/JJ ./.

They/PPSS were/BED becoming/VBG confused/VBN ./.

Perhaps/RB it/PPS was/BEDZ because/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ so/QL late/JJ ,/, and/CC because/CS she/PPS had/HVD no/AT business/NN to/TO be/BE here/RB now/RB ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ thinking/VBG of/IN Paul/NP a/AT few/AP weeks/NNS ago/RB ,/, in/IN the/AT Easter/NP holidays/NNS ,/, with/IN her/PPO at/IN one/CD of/IN those/DTS awful/JJ Friday/NR Evening/NN Dancing/VBG Class/NN parties/NNS her/PP$ mother/NN had/HVD made/VBN her/PP$ attend/VB ./.

``/`` Hello/UH ,/, Julie/NP ,/, how/WRB are/BER you/PPO ''/'' ?/. ?/.

He/PPS was/BEDZ staring/VBG at/IN the/AT blue/JJ china/NN lamp/NN left/VBN on/RP beside/IN him/PPO ./.

It/PPS seemed/VBD too/QL much/AP trouble/NN even/RB to/TO reach/VB for/IN the/AT switch/NN ;/. ;/.

Below/IN him/PPO ,/, as/CS if/CS at/IN the/AT end/NN of/IN some/DTI remote/JJ tunnel/NN ,/, he/PPS heard/VBD the/AT humming/NN of/IN a/AT vacuum/NN cleaner/NN ./.

His/PP$ fingers/NNS fumbled/VBD across/IN the/AT bandages/NNS ./.

They/PPSS had/HVD left/VBN both/ABX of/IN his/PP$ eyes/NNS uncovered/VBN ./.

Well/UH ,/, he/PPS told/VBD himself/PPL ,/, let's/VB+PPO put/VB the/AT show/NN on/IN the/AT road/NN ./.

He/PPS drank/VBD a/AT glass/NN of/IN water/NN and/CC gripped/VBD the/AT sink/NN with/IN both/ABX hands/NNS ./.

A/AT fearful/JJ pain/NN had/HVD come/VBN from/IN his/PP$ head/NN ,/, as/CS if/CS the/AT water/NN were/BED coursing/VBG up/RP through/IN the/AT blood/NN vessels/NNS and/CC expanding/VBG them/PPO ./.

A/AT quarter/NN to/IN seven/CD ./.

Too/QL early/RB for/IN a/AT vacuum/NN cleaner/NN ,/, but/CC probably/RB Sam/NP wanted/VBD the/AT whole/JJ house/NN in/IN order/NN before/CS he/PPS came/VBD downstairs/RB ./.

This/DT was/BEDZ some/DTI freak/NN ,/, two/CD strands/NNS of/IN adhesive/JJ tape/NN across/IN his/PP$ nose/NN ,/, like/CS ugly/JJ roots/NNS from/IN the/AT mass/NN of/IN gauze/NN ,/, suddenly/RB moist/JJ over/IN his/PP$ cheekbones/NNS ./.

A/AT row/NN of/IN little/JJ hangers/NNS waited/VBD for/IN a/AT child's/NN$ clothes/NNS in/IN the/AT neatly/RB empty/JJ closet/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT closet/NN was/BEDZ faintly/RB fragrant/JJ with/IN lavender/NN ,/, and/CC as/CS Lucy/NP shut/VBD the/AT door/NN an/AT unhappy/JJ memory/NN slipped/VBD into/IN her/PP$ mind/NN ,/, like/CS a/AT lavender/NN ghost/NN :/: Greg's/NP$ house/NN ,/, on/IN the/AT day/NN he/PPS was/BEDZ buried/VBN ,/, and/CC the/AT child/NN ,/, pale/JJ ,/, silent/JJ ,/, baffled/VBN ,/, watching/VBG the/AT funeral/NN guests/NNS with/IN panicky/JJ eyes/NNS ./.

Many/AP times/NNS since/IN his/PP$ death/NN that/DT memory/NN had/HVD worried/VBN and/CC troubled/VBD her/PPO ./.

A/AT profession/NN that/WPS brought/VBD me/PPO as/QL good/JJ an/AT income/NN as/CS mine/PP$$ wasn't/BEDZ* to/TO be/BE sneezed/VBN at/IN ./.

Maybe/RB her/PP$ ravenous/JJ eating/NN wasn't/BEDZ* grotesque/JJ because/CS she/PPS was/BEDZ so/QL positive/JJ about/IN it/PPO ./.

I/PPSS made/VBD the/AT mistake/NN of/IN going/VBG to/IN the/AT Jour/NN et/CC Nuit/NN ./.

A/AT good/JJ binge/NN has/HVZ that/DT kind/NN of/IN therapeutic/JJ value/NN ./.

Sometime/RB earlier/RBR the/AT weather/NN had/HVD turned/VBN cold/JJ and/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ snowing/VBG ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ another/DT human/NN being/NN and/CC happened/VBD to/TO be/BE a/AT hustler/NN ./.

I/PPSS didn't/DOD* much/RB care/VB if/CS she/PPS were/BED there/RB or/CC not/* ./.

(/( I/PPSS didn't/DOD* have/HV on/RP a/AT hat/NN ./.

Hardly/RB glancing/VBG at/IN her/PPO ,/, I/PPSS smiled/VBD a/AT bleak/JJ one/PN which/WDT said/VBD ,/, Thanks/NNS ,/, baby/NN ,/, but/CC I'd/PPSS+MD rather/RB be/BE alone/RB ./.

``/`` I'm/PPSS+BEM not/* unhappy/JJ ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS lied/VBD ,/, staring/VBG at/IN the/AT snow/NN ./.

``/`` Is/BEZ it/PPS a/AT woman/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` Well/UH --/-- women/NNS and/CC unhappiness/NN go/VB together/RB ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS observed/VBD profoundly/RB ,/, adding/VBG ,/, ``/`` You/PPSS can/MD wager/VB your/PP$ derriere/NN on/IN that/DT ''/'' ./.

``/`` Ah/UH ,/, Monsieur/NP ,/, it/PPS is/BEZ not/* my/PP$ business/NN to/TO wager/VB it/PPO ./.

''/''

This/DT took/VBD me/PPO so/QL funny/JJ I/PPSS had/HVD to/TO look/VB at/IN her/PPO ./.

I/PPSS even/RB snorted/VBD a/AT chuckle/NN ./.

She/PPS smiled/VBD at/IN me/PPO ,/, but/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ an/AT awfully/QL sad/JJ smile/NN ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ even/RB more/QL miserable/JJ than/CS me/PPO ./.

I/PPSS could/MD see/VB the/AT ancient/JJ cynicism/NN reinforce/VB itself/PPL in/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PPSS wondered/VBD how/WRB many/AP men/NNS she/PPS had/HVD picked/VBN up/RP with/IN this/DT same/AP gambit/NN ./.

Anyway/RB ,/, I/PPSS pulled/VBD a/AT bottle/NN of/IN Remy/NP Martin/NP out/IN of/IN my/PP$ topcoat/NN ,/, drew/VBD the/AT cork/NN ,/, and/CC passed/VBD it/PPO to/IN her/PPO ./.

It's/PPS+BEZ really/QL rotten/JJ to/TO drink/VB good/JJ cognac/NN like/CS that/DT ,/, but/CC I/PPSS hadn't/HVD* cared/VBN before/RB ./.

No/AT child/NN ,/, this/DT tart/NN ,/, she/PPS must/MD have/HV been/BEN thirty-five/CD or/CC even/RB forty/CD ./.

I/PPSS couldn't/MD* be/BE sure/JJ ./.

Not/* good/JJ looking/VBG ,/, but/CC self-confident/JJ and/CC wise/JJ so/CS that/CS it/PPS made/VBD her/PPO attractive/JJ ./.

I/PPSS liked/VBD her/PPO ,/, and/CC all/ABN at/IN once/CS I/PPSS was/BEDZ glad/JJ she/PPS was/BEDZ there/RB ./.

We/PPSS finished/VBD the/AT bottle/NN --/-- I/PPSS hadn't/HVD* had/HVN a/AT lot/NN out/IN of/IN it/PPO earlier/RBR --/-- not/* speaking/VBG much/RB to/IN each/DT other/AP ,/, and/CC we/PPSS stayed/VBD sober/JJ ./.

We/PPSS seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE drowsing/VBG ,/, sadly/RB ,/, soberly/RB ,/, in/IN the/AT cold/JJ ,/, cold/JJ air/NN while/CS the/AT snow/NN fell/VBD ./.

Then/RB she/PPS said/VBD ,/, ``/`` Allons/VB ''/'' ,/, and/CC we/PPSS got/VBD up/RP and/CC went/VBD to/IN my/PP$ hotel/NN without/IN another/DT word/NN ./.

I/PPSS sensed/VBD no/AT stranger/NN in/IN her/PPO ./.

We/PPSS undressed/VBD and/CC made/VBD love/NN with/IN the/AT comfortable/JJ acceptance/NN I/PPSS had/HVD once/RB known/VBN with/IN Valery/NP ./.

I/PPSS decided/VBD thirty-five/CD was/BEDZ the/AT best/JJT estimate/NN of/IN her/PP$ age/NN ./.

She/PPS had/HVD a/AT funny/JJ little/AP scar/NN on/IN her/PP$ stomach/NN ,/, on/IN the/AT left/JJ side/NN ./.

I/PPSS think/VB we/PPSS were/BED very/QL tired/VBN ,/, for/CS we/PPSS awoke/VBD at/IN the/AT same/AP moment/NN ,/, deeply/RB rested/VBN ,/, surprised/VBN to/TO see/VB the/AT late/JJ morning/NN sun/NN on/IN the/AT windows/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/BED wet/JJ where/WRB the/AT rime/NN had/HVD melted/VBN ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD wonderful/JJ ,/, the/AT absolute/JJ opposite/NN of/IN last/AP night's/NN$ melancholy/NN ./.

My/PP$ head/NN was/BEDZ clear/JJ ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ hungry/JJ as/CS a/AT wolf/NN ,/, and/CC my/PP$ body/NN felt/VBD lean/JJ and/CC vital/JJ ./.

``/`` Bon/JJ jour/NN ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS said/VBD brightly/RB ,/, sitting/VBG up/RP ,/, which/WDT pulled/VBD the/AT covers/NNS to/IN her/PP$ hips/NNS ./.

``/`` Bon/JJ jour/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

She/PPS exclaimed/VBD ,/, smiling/VBG ./.

``/`` J'ai/PPSS+HV faim/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

``/`` Yeah/RB ,/, but/CC breakfast/NN first/RB ''/'' ./.

With/IN a/AT laugh/NN she/PPS beat/VBD me/PPO to/IN the/AT bathroom/NN ./.

I/PPSS called/VBD downstairs/RB for/IN food/NN and/CC a/AT toothbrush/NN for/IN her/PPO ./.

``/`` The/AT toothbrush/NN Monsieur/NP ''/'' ,/, he/PPS said/VBD ,/, presenting/VBG it/PPO ./.

But/CC I/PPSS smelled/VBD the/AT coffee/NN ,/, and/CC thinking/VBG ,/, What/WDT the/AT hell/NN ,/, live/VB dangerously/RB ,/, I/PPSS decided/VBD I/PPSS would/MD scald/VB my/PP$ worries/NNS away/RB ./.

The/AT coffee/NN wasn't/BEDZ* very/QL hot/JJ though/RB ,/, made/VBN in/IN a/AT filter/NN pot/NN ,/, but/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ good/JJ ./.

We/PPSS sent/VBD the/AT waiter/NN away/RB and/CC ate/VBD a/AT tremendous/JJ amount/VB of/IN cold/JJ ham/NN ,/, hot/JJ hard-boiled/JJ eggs/NNS and/CC hot/JJ garlic/NN bread/NN ./.

``/`` Yes/RB ,/, because/CS you/PPSS didn't/DOD* run/VB off/RP to/TO use/VB that/DT new/JJ toothbrush/NN ''/'' ./.

I/PPSS put/VBD aside/RB my/PP$ empty/JJ cup/NN ./.

``/`` What/WDT is/BEZ this/DT from/IN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

I/PPSS asked/VBD ,/, touching/VBG the/AT scar/NN on/IN her/PP$ stomach/NN ./.

``/`` A/AT bullet/NN ''/'' ,/, she/PPS answered/VBD ./.

She/PPS understood/VBD sex/NN anyway/RB ,/, and/CC played/VBD at/IN it/PPO well/RB ./.

Theresa/NP Stubblefield/NP ,/, still/RB holding/VBG the/AT family/NN letters/NNS in/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, realized/VBD that/CS her/PP$ whole/JJ trip/NN to/IN Europe/NP was/BEDZ viewed/VBN in/IN family/NN circles/NNS as/CS an/AT interlude/NN between/IN Cousin/NN Elec's/NP$ death/NN and/CC ``/`` doing/VBG something/PN ''/'' about/IN Cousin/NN Emma/NP ./.

His/PP$ smile/NN was/BEDZ quick/JJ ,/, and/CC his/PP$ eyes/NNS held/VBD some/DTI promised/VBN secret/NN that/WPS made/VBD my/PP$ knees/NNS go/VB limp/JJ ./.

The/AT most/QL unbelievable/JJ thing/NN about/IN the/AT chance/NN meeting/NN was/BEDZ that/CS he/PPS seemed/VBD interested/VBN in/IN me/PPO ,/, too/RB ./.

But/CC then/RB he/PPS had/HVD said/VBN ,/, ``/`` All/QL right/RB ,/, kid/NN ,/, if/CS that's/DT+BEZ how/WRB you/PPSS want/VB it/PPO ,/, that's/DT+BEZ how/WRB it'll/PPS+MD be/BE ''/'' ./.

But/CC what/WDT had/HVD I/PPSS done/VBN ,/, trying/VBG to/TO keep/VB us/PPO pure/JJ ?/. ?/.

I/PPSS had/HVD driven/VBN him/PPO into/IN the/AT arms/NNS of/IN that/DT scheming/VBG woman/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD just/RB the/AT same/AP as/CS delivered/VBD him/PPO into/IN the/AT hands/NNS of/IN the/AT Devil/NN !/. !/.

So/CS one/CD week/NN later/RBR ,/, I/PPSS surrendered/VBD to/IN him/PPO in/IN the/AT little/AP motel/NN on/IN Route/NN 10/CD ./.

My/PP$ very/QL first/OD time/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ desperate/JJ to/TO hold/VB him/PPO ,/, to/TO give/VB him/PPO whatever/WDT in/IN this/DT world/NN he/PPS wanted/VBD or/CC needed/VBD ,/, and/CC to/TO keep/VB him/PPO from/IN the/AT clutches/NNS of/IN Lucille/NP Warren/NP ./.

And/CC ,/, though/CS at/IN the/AT time/NN I/PPSS blushed/VBD to/TO admit/VB it/PPO even/RB to/IN myself/PPL ,/, there/EX was/BEDZ in/IN me/PPO a/AT growing/VBG desire/NN ,/, a/AT sexual/JJ awareness/NN ,/, that/CS Johnnie/NP had/HVD set/VBN in/IN motion/NN ,/, an/AT awareness/NN that/CS no/AT other/AP man/NN had/HVD ever/RB triggered/VBN ./.

I/PPSS wanted/VBD him/PPO ,/, with/IN a/AT terrifying/VBG fierceness/NN ./.

Astonishingly/RB enough/QLP ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ my/PP$ own/JJ voice/NN I/PPSS heard/VBD there/RB in/IN the/AT darkness/NN ,/, begging/VBG this/DT man/NN to/TO make/VB love/NN to/IN me/PPO ./.

``/`` Love/VB me/PPO ,/, Johnnie/NP ''/'' ./.

``/`` I/PPSS will/MD ,/, kitten/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

Outside/RB ,/, in/IN the/AT summertime/NN fields/NNS behind/IN the/AT motel/NN ,/, a/AT thousand/CD crickets/NNS serenaded/VBD us/PPO ./.

``/`` Uh/UH huh/UH ./.

``/`` Mmm/UH ''/'' ./.

And/CC I/PPSS snuggled/VBD closer/RBR to/IN the/AT man/NN I/PPSS loved/VBD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ as/QL blissful/JJ and/CC fulfilling/VBG a/AT night/NN as/CS any/DTI bride/NN ever/RB experienced/VBD ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD had/HVN no/AT wedding/NN ceremony/NN ,/, no/AT witnesses/NNS ,/, no/AT certificate/NN of/IN marriage/NN ,/, but/CC I/PPSS had/HVD all/ABN the/AT joy/NN that/DT goes/VBZ with/IN them/PPO ./.

``/`` Johnnie/NP ?/. ?/.

``/`` It/PPS can't/MD* be/BE wrong/JJ ,/, can/MD it/PPS ?/. ?/.

Johnnie/NP rose/VBD on/IN one/CD elbow/NN ./.

``/`` Stop/VB worrying/VBG ./.

It's/PPS+BEZ never/RB wrong/JJ if/CS love/NN is/BEZ real/JJ ''/'' ./.

I/PPSS took/VBD great/JJ comfort/NN from/IN his/PP$ words/NNS ,/, and/CC smiled/VBD to/IN myself/PPL in/IN the/AT darkness/NN ./.

Infinite/JJ peace/NN ,/, complete/JJ contentment/NN ./.

Idiot's/NN$ delight/NN ,/, I/PPSS later/RBR discovered/VBD ./.

I/PPSS felt/VBD no/AT conflict/NN between/IN what/WDT I/PPSS was/BEDZ doing/VBG and/CC my/PP$ strict/JJ religious/JJ upbringing/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD always/RB resisted/VBN the/AT passes/NNS made/VBN at/IN me/PPO by/IN other/AP kids/NNS ,/, and/CC many/AP times/NNS I/PPSS had/HVD thought/VBN about/IN my/PP$ love/NN for/IN Johnnie/NP who/WPS ,/, being/BEG thirty/CD ,/, brought/VBD a/AT maturity/NN to/IN love/NN that/CS the/AT kids/NNS around/IN town/NN could/MD know/VB nothing/PN about/RB ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD also/RB thought/VBN a/AT lot/NN about/IN how/WRB God/NP must/MD look/VB on/IN true/JJ love/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB in/IN a/AT way/NN I/PPSS was/BEDZ keeping/VBG my/PP$ promise/NN to/IN God/NP ,/, my/PP$ promise/NN to/TO remain/VB pure/JJ until/CS I/PPSS was/BEDZ married/VBN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ practically/RB a/AT bride/NN ,/, after/IN all/ABN ./.

There/EX would/MD have/HV been/BEN a/AT ceremony/NN if/CS it/PPS had/HVD been/BEN possible/JJ ./.

Of/IN this/DT ,/, I/PPSS had/HVD no/AT doubt/NN ./.

Wouldn't/MD* Johnnie/NP do/DO practically/RB anything/PN in/IN the/AT world/NN to/TO insure/VB my/PP$ happiness/NN ?/. ?/.

Of/IN course/NN he/PPS would/MD ./.

He'd/PPS+HVD not/* only/RB told/VBN me/PPO so/CS ,/, he'd/PPS+HVD proved/VBN it/PPO ./.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* Johnnie's/NP$ fault/NN that/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ hopelessly/RB tied/VBN down/RP to/IN that/DT frightful/JJ woman/NN who/WPS did/DOD her/PP$ best/JJT to/TO make/VB his/PP$ life/NN unbearable/JJ ./.

Just/RB because/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ honorable/JJ enough/QLP to/TO want/VB to/TO continue/VB supporting/VBG his/PP$ two/CD children/NNS ,/, as/CS any/DTI decent/JJ man/NN would/MD ,/, that/DT was/BEDZ no/AT reason/NN he/PPS should/MD be/BE denied/VBN his/PP$ own/JJ small/JJ share/NN of/IN happiness/NN too/RB ./.

And/CC if/CS I/PPSS could/MD contribute/VB to/IN that/DT ,/, I'd/PPSS+MD do/DO it/PPO ./.

The/AT cost/NN didn't/DOD* matter/VB ./.

No/AT price/NN is/BEZ too/QL high/JJ when/WRB true/JJ love/NN is/BEZ at/IN stake/NN ./.

And/CC I/PPSS had/HVD no/AT doubts/NNS about/IN how/QL true/JJ this/DT love/NN was/BEDZ ./.

I'd/PPSS+HVD never/RB even/RB petted/VBN with/IN a/AT boy/NN ,/, and/CC after/CS I/PPSS met/VBD Johnnie/NP he/PPS never/RB touched/VBD me/PPO for/IN the/AT longest/JJT while/NN ,/, not/* until/CS I/PPSS all/ABN but/IN threw/VBD myself/PPL at/IN him/PPO ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ plenty/RB attentive/JJ ,/, all/QL right/RB ,/, but/CC he/PPS behaved/VBD like/CS a/AT gentleman/NN ,/, and/CC I/PPSS figured/VBD that/CS ,/, emotionally/RB ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ closer/RBR to/IN his/PP$ age/NN than/CS to/IN my/PP$ own/JJ eighteen/CD and/CC a/AT half/ABN ./.

What/WDT could/MD a/AT mere/JJ twelve/CD years/NNS matter/VB ?/. ?/.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* ,/, I/PPSS was/BEDZ sure/JJ ,/, a/AT difference/NN in/IN age/NN that/WPS came/VBD between/IN people/NNS ,/, but/CC a/AT difference/NN in/IN maturity/NN ./.

And/CC hadn't/HVD* I/PPSS rescued/VBN him/PPO from/IN Lucille/NP Warren/NP ?/. ?/.

She'd/PPS+MD have/HV gotten/VBN him/PPO ,/, if/CS I/PPSS hadn't/HVD* stopped/VBN her/PPO ./.

After/IN all/ABN ,/, Lucille/NP Warren/NP was/BEDZ a/AT husband-stealer/NN from/IN way/NN back/RB ./.

But/CC I'd/PPSS+HVD been/BEN a/AT good/JJ girl/NN and/CC now/RB God/NP was/BEDZ blessing/VBG me/PPO with/IN the/AT gift/NN of/IN this/DT magnificent/JJ man/NN and/CC the/AT wondrous/JJ love/NN we/PPSS shared/VBD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ only/RB fitting/VBG that/CS we/PPSS seek/VB out/RP whatever/WDT joy/NN our/PP$ union/NN might/MD bring/VB ./.

``/`` Love/VB me/PPO ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` Uh-huh/UH ./.

``/`` Always/RB and/CC always/RB ,/, Johnnie/NP ''/'' ?/. ?/.

``/`` Always/RB ''/'' ./.

``/`` Mmm/UH ''/'' ./.

Convention/NN time/NN in/IN Boston/NP ./.

A/AT chill/NN wind/NN in/IN the/AT air/NN and/CC the/AT narrow/JJ streets/NNS packed/VBN with/IN snow/NN ./.

From/IN the/AT entire/JJ eastern/JJ half/ABN of/IN the/AT nation/NN they'd/PPSS+MD be/BE coming/VBG ,/, members/NNS of/IN the/AT Young/JJ Christians'/NPS$ League/NN ,/, and/CC I'd/PPSS+HVD been/BEN chosen/VBN to/TO represent/VB our/PP$ chapter/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD mixed/VBN emotions/NNS about/IN going/VBG ./.

I'd/PPSS+HVD been/BEN seeing/VBG Johnnie/NP almost/RB a/AT year/NN now/RB ,/, but/CC I/PPSS still/RB didn't/DOD* want/VB to/TO leave/VB him/PPO for/IN five/CD whole/JJ days/NNS ./.

But/CC I/PPSS had/HVD looked/VBN forward/RB so/QL much/RB to/IN being/BEG with/IN this/DT church/NN group/NN ./.

I/PPSS hadn't/HVD* been/BEN doing/VBG as/QL much/AP work/NN as/CS I/PPSS used/VBD to/TO in/IN Westfield/NP and/CC I/PPSS felt/VBD funny/JJ about/IN that/DT and/CC wanted/VBD to/TO work/VB harder/RBR than/CS ever/RB ./.

I/PPSS wanted/VBD to/TO just/RB throw/VB myself/PPL into/IN the/AT good/JJ works/NNS of/IN this/DT fine/JJ group/NN ./.

So/CS I/PPSS went/VBD to/IN Boston/NP ./.

The/AT first/OD meeting/NN was/BEDZ held/VBN in/IN Faneuil/NP Hall/NN ,/, a/AT great/QL big/JJ place/NN where/WRB we/PPSS were/BED able/JJ to/TO meet/VB members/NNS from/IN all/ABN the/AT other/AP states/NNS ./.

My/PP$ cousin/NN Alma/NP ,/, at/IN whose/WP$ home/NR I/PPSS was/BEDZ staying/VBG during/IN the/AT convention/NN ,/, introduced/VBD me/PPO to/IN a/AT group/NN of/IN young/JJ people/NNS from/IN Rhode/NP Island/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN them/PPO was/BEDZ a/AT very/QL friendly/JJ ,/, lovely/JJ fellow/NN named/VBN Ronald/NP ,/, a/AT boy/NN about/IN my/PP$ age/NN with/IN slick/JJ ,/, blond/JJ hair/NN and/CC dancing/VBG blue/JJ eyes/NNS ./.

He/PPS looked/VBD very/QL different/JJ from/IN Johnnie/NP --/-- in/IN fact/NN ,/, he/PPS looked/VBD sort/NN of/IN like/IN me/PPO ./.

I/PPSS thought/VBD so/RB ,/, and/CC he/PPS mentioned/VBD it/PPO ,/, and/CC Alma/NP said/VBD so/RB too/RB ./.

After/IN the/AT meeting/NN ,/, there/EX was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO be/BE a/AT party/NN at/IN someone's/PN$ house/NN ./.

I/PPSS assumed/VBD Alma/NP would/MD get/VB me/PPO there/RB ,/, but/CC in/IN the/AT confusion/NN of/IN the/AT meeting/NN breaking/VBG up/RP ,/, we/PPSS were/BED separated/VBN ./.

Outside/IN the/AT hall/NN ,/, I/PPSS anxiously/RB looked/VBD around/RB for/IN her/PPO ,/, then/RB all/ABN at/IN once/RB there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT hand/NN on/IN my/PP$ elbow/NN ./.

``/`` Hey/UH ,/, there/RB ,/, beautiful/JJ twin/NN of/IN mine/PP$$ ''/'' ,/, Ronald/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` Need/VB a/AT pumpkin/NN to/TO get/VB to/IN the/AT party/NN ''/'' ?/. ?/.

I/PPSS couldn't/MD* help/VB laughing/VBG with/IN him/PPO ./.

``/`` Well/UH ,/, I/PPSS should/MD find/VB Alma/NP ''/'' --/-- I/PPSS began/VBD ./.

``/`` Alma/NP ,/, Schmalma/NP ./.

Come/VB along/RB with/IN me/PPO ''/'' ./.

I/PPSS went/VBD ./.

By/IN the/AT time/NN we/PPSS arrived/VBD ,/, the/AT party/NN was/BEDZ already/RB going/VBG strong/JJ ./.

A/AT couple/NN of/IN the/AT girls/NNS were/BED laughing/VBG rather/QL shrilly/RB and/CC I/PPSS realized/VBD they/PPSS were/BED drinking/VBG ./.

My/PP$ folks/NNS wouldn't/MD* dream/VB of/IN having/HVG alcohol/NN in/IN the/AT house/NN ,/, so/CS my/PP$ first/OD taste/NN of/IN it/PPO had/HVD been/BEN --/-- of/IN course/NN --/-- with/IN Johnnie/NP ./.

I/PPSS hadn't/HVD* liked/VBN it/PPO at/IN first/RB --/-- it/PPS was/BEDZ bitter/JJ and/CC burning/VBG ./.

But/CC when/WRB Johnnie/NP disguised/VBD the/AT taste/NN with/IN ginger/NN ale/NN ,/, I/PPSS enjoyed/VBD it/PPO ./.

Of/IN course/NN I/PPSS enjoyed/VBD 'most/RB anything/PN if/CS I/PPSS did/DOD it/PPO with/IN Johnnie/NP ./.

Johnnie/NP I/PPSS suddenly/RB realized/VBD he'd/PPS+HVD been/BEN totally/RB out/IN of/IN my/PP$ thoughts/NNS all/ABN evening/NN ./.

But/CC that/DT was/BEDZ only/RB natural/JJ ,/, I/PPSS decided/VBD ;/. ;/.

surely/RB he/PPS was/BEDZ still/RB resting/VBG snugly/RB in/IN my/PP$ heart/NN ./.

``/`` I/PPSS don't/DO* see/VB Alma/NP anywhere/RB ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS said/VBD ./.

``/`` She's/PPS+BEZ invisible/JJ tonight/NR ./.

C'mon/UH ,/, let's/VB+PPO find/VB out/RP where/WRB they're/PPSS+BER keeping/VBG the/AT glasses/NNS ''/'' ./.

I/PPSS drew/VBD back/RB ./.

``/`` I/PPSS --/-- I/PPSS don't/DO* think/VB so/RB ,/, Ronald/NP ./.

Not/* for/IN me/PPO ''/'' ./.

``/`` Aw/UH ,/, come/VB on/RP ''/'' ./.

``/`` No/RB --/-- really/RB ''/'' ./.

He/PPS shrugged/VBD ./.

``/`` Okay/UH ./.

But/CC at/IN least/AP come/VB along/RB while/CS I/PPSS get/VB lubricated/VBN ''/'' ./.

The/AT kitchen/NN was/BEDZ jammed/VBN ./.

Strange/JJ faces/NNS ,/, most/AP of/IN them/PPO ,/, and/CC I/PPSS wasn't/BEDZ* even/RB sure/JJ all/ABN of/IN them/PPO had/HVD come/VBN from/IN the/AT League/NN meeting/NN ./.

Under/IN normal/JJ circumstances/NNS ,/, he/PPS had/HVD a/AT certain/JJ bright-eyed/JJ all-American-boy/JJ charm/NN ,/, with/IN great/JJ appeal/NN for/IN young/JJ ladies/NNS ,/, old/JJ ladies/NNS ,/, and/CC dogs/NNS ./.

Today/NR ,/, he/PPS looked/VBD like/CS an/AT Astronaut/NN who/WPS had/HVD left/VBN his/PP$ vitamin/NN pills/NNS on/IN the/AT bureau/NN and/CC spent/VBN six/CD months/NNS in/IN space/NN :/: hollow/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, hollow/JJ cheeks/NNS ,/, hollow/JJ stomach/NN ./.

Breakfast/NN ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD ./.

A/AT shot/NN of/IN orange/NN juice/NN would/MD make/VB everything/PN seem/VB better/RBR ./.

He/PPS looked/VBD around/IN his/PP$ little/AP Eden/NP :/: bureau/NN ,/, bed/NN ,/, table/NN ,/, chair/NN ,/, two-burner/JJ stove/NN ./.

Then/RB he/PPS remembered/VBD ./.

``/`` You/PPSS share/VB a/AT refrigerator/NN ''/'' ,/, Mrs./NP Kirby/NP had/HVD said/VBN ,/, and/CC somehow/RB ,/, at/IN midnight/NN ,/, after/IN the/AT long/JJ drive/NN from/IN New/JJ York/NP in/IN pelting/VBG rain/NN ,/, that/CS had/HVD sounded/VBN reasonable/JJ ./.

She/PPS had/HVD explained/VBN it/PPO --/-- something/PN about/IN summer/NN people's/NNS$ eating/NN out/RP and/CC not/* enough/AP space/NN in/IN the/AT units/NNS ./.

And/CC where/WRB was/BEDZ the/AT thing/NN ?/. ?/.

He/PPS remembered/VBD seeing/VBG it/PPO last/AP night/NN ,/, when/WRB he/PPS put/VBD away/RB his/PP$ small/JJ store/NN of/IN bachelor-type/JJ eatables/NNS ./.

Ah/UH ,/, yes/RB --/-- his/PP$ half/ABN of/IN a/AT refrigerator/NN stood/VBD outside/RB ,/, on/IN the/AT ``/`` curving/VBG veranda/NN ''/'' between/IN Unit/NN Number/NN Three/CD and/CC Unit/NN Number/NN Four/CD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ still/RB raining/VBG ,/, and/CC Mrs./NP Kirby's/NP$ cottages/NNS bloomed/VBD through/IN the/AT gray/JJ haze/NN like/CS the/AT names/NNS they/PPSS bore/VBD ,/, vivid/JJ blue/JJ and/CC green/JJ and/CC magenta/JJ ./.

Charlie/NP downed/VBD his/PP$ orange/NN juice/NN and/CC one/PN of/IN the/AT long/JJ ,/, skinny/JJ green/JJ pills/NNS ,/, his/PP$ spirits/NNS as/QL damp/JJ as/CS the/AT day/NN ./.

This/DT vacation/NN had/HVD seemed/VBN like/CS a/AT good/JJ idea/NN last/AP week/NN ,/, when/WRB his/PP$ doctor/NN had/HVD prescribed/VBN it/PPO ./.

``/`` Take/VB a/AT full/JJ month/NN ''/'' ,/, the/AT doctor/NN had/HVD said/VBN ./.

``/`` Lots/NNS of/IN sun/NN ,/, lots/NNS of/IN rest/NN ./.

He/PPS had/HVD loved/VBN and/CC lost/VBN Vivian/NP Wayne/NP to/IN somebody/PN else/RB ,/, had/HVD watched/VBN her/PPO marry/VB the/AT somebody/PN else/RB ,/, and/CC had/HVD caught/VBN a/AT bear/NN of/IN a/AT cold/NN by/IN kissing/VBG the/AT bride/NN good-by/NN forever/RB ,/, which/WDT was/BEDZ really/RB piling/VBG it/PPO on/RP ./.

Once/RB burned/VBN --/-- scalded/VBN ,/, really/RB ,/, because/CS Vivian/NP had/HVD given/VBN him/PPO every/AT encouragement/NN --/-- forever/RB shy/JJ ./.

From/IN now/RB on/RP ,/, his/PP$$ was/BEDZ going/VBG to/TO be/BE a/AT man's/NN$ world/NN :/: the/AT North/JJ Woods/NNS ,/, duck/NN blinds/NNS at/IN dawning/VBG ,/, beer/NN and/CC poker/NN and/CC male/NN secretaries/NNS ./.

Everything/PN being/BEG the/AT sweater/NN ,/, a/AT lipstick/NN case/NN ,/, and/CC a/AT squirt/NN bottle/NN of/IN Kissin'/NN Kare/NN pink/JJ hand/NN lotion/NN ./.

The/AT note/NN paper/NN was/BEDZ pink/JJ ,/, too/RB ,/, and/CC the/AT handwriting/NN small/JJ and/CC dainty/JJ and/CC utterly/RB feminine/JJ ./.

Pink/JJ ,/, Vivian/NP once/RB had/HVD told/VBN him/PPO ,/, was/BEDZ for/IN baby/NN girls/NNS ,/, and/CC grown-up/JJ girls/NNS who/WPS wore/VBD pink/NN were/BED subconsciously/RB clinging/VBG to/IN their/PP$ infancy/NN ./.

``/`` M-m-m/UH ./.

Richard/NP left/VBD America/NP with/IN his/PP$ clothes/NNS ,/, his/PP$ biwa/NN and/CC his/PP$ image/NN of/IN Acala/NP and/CC ,/, on/IN the/AT freighter/NN which/WDT took/VBD him/PPO to/IN Japan/NP ,/, he/PPS plucked/VBD at/IN the/AT biwa/NN ,/, trying/VBG to/TO make/VB the/AT sounds/NNS he/PPS wrought/VBD resemble/VB an/AT ancient/JJ Japanese/JJ tune/NN he/PPS had/HVD once/RB heard/VBN ./.

During/IN his/PP$ second/OD week/NN at/IN sea/NN he/PPS brought/VBD the/AT curious/JJ melody/NN out/IN of/IN the/AT instrument/NN and/CC suddenly/RB wanted/VBD to/TO force/VB the/AT biwa/NN to/TO remain/VB at/IN just/RB that/DT moment/NN in/IN its/PP$ history/NN when/WRB it/PPS had/HVD given/VBN him/PPO pleasure/NN ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ so/QL dark/JJ that/CS he/PPS didn't/DOD* see/VB it/PPO hit/VB the/AT water/NN and/CC the/AT noisy/JJ rush/NN of/IN the/AT ocean/NN kept/VBD him/PPO from/IN hearing/VBG it/PPO ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ as/CS though/CS the/AT biwa/NN had/HVD been/BEN eaten/VBN up/RP by/IN the/AT wind/NN ./.

In/IN Tokyo/NP Richard/NP took/VBD up/RP a/AT life/NN similar/JJ to/IN that/DT which/WDT he/PPS had/HVD lived/VBN in/IN New/JJ York/NP ,/, except/IN that/CS he/PPS had/HVD replaced/VBN his/PP$ biwa/NN with/IN a/AT friend/NN ./.

An/AT American/JJ student/NN named/VBN Charlotte/NP Adams/NP had/HVD refused/VBN to/TO take/VB notice/NN of/IN his/PP$ evident/JJ aversion/NN to/IN people/NNS and/CC had/HVD at/IN last/RB succeeded/VBD in/IN getting/VBG him/PPO to/TO talk/VB to/IN her/PPO ./.

He/PPS had/HVD nothing/PN much/AP to/TO say/VB to/IN her/PPO but/CC that/CS he/PPS said/VBD anything/PN seemed/VBD to/TO please/VB her/PPO and/CC he/PPS accompanied/VBD her/PPO on/IN some/DTI of/IN her/PP$ unusually/RB searching/VBG tours/NNS of/IN Tokyo/NP ./.

In/IN Charlotte/NP ,/, Richard/NP saw/VBD a/AT frankness/NN and/CC a/AT zest/NN for/IN doing/VBG things/NNS which/WDT ,/, after/IN a/AT fashion/NN ,/, he/PPS envied/VBD ./.

In/IN time/NN ,/, he/PPS grew/VBD to/TO depend/VB upon/IN her/PP$ occasional/JJ company/NN and/CC she/PPS at/IN length/NN was/BEDZ able/JJ to/TO encourage/VB him/PPO to/TO participate/VB in/IN more/QL social/JJ activity/NN ./.

She/PPS convinced/VBD him/PPO that/CS he/PPS ought/MD to/TO be/BE a/AT member/NN of/IN some/DTI of/IN the/AT small/JJ tea-drinking/JJ parties/NNS she/PPS held/VBD at/IN her/PP$ rooms/NNS and/CC in/IN the/AT end/NN he/PPS complied/VBD with/IN her/PP$ wishes/NNS ,/, although/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ only/RB rarely/RB that/CS he/PPS added/VBD anything/PN to/IN the/AT random/JJ conversations/NNS ./.

Perhaps/RB he/PPS sensed/VBD some/DTI connection/NN between/IN the/AT incident/NN on/IN the/AT freighter/NN and/CC the/AT ascetic/NN at/IN Ryusenji/NP ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ unable/JJ to/TO put/VB it/PPO together/RB ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ surprised/VBN by/IN the/AT sharp/JJ sensation/NN he/PPS experienced/VBD as/CS he/PPS approached/VBD the/AT pool/NN which/WDT Charlotte/NP had/HVD mentioned/VBN ./.

On/IN the/AT hillside/NN above/RB was/BEDZ caged/VBN what/WDT might/MD have/HV been/BEN an/AT incarnation/NN of/IN Fudo/NP ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB a/AT demon/NN ./.

The/AT strange/JJ creature/NN ,/, housed/VBN in/IN wire/NN ,/, made/VBD him/PPO shudder/VB ./.

The/AT sensation/NN he/PPS so/QL overwhelmingly/RB realized/VBN was/BEDZ one/PN which/WDT told/VBD him/PPO he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN there/RB before/RB but/CC he/PPS knew/VBD he/PPS had/HVD not/* ,/, and/CC could/MD not/* recall/VB any/DTI place/NN he/PPS had/HVD visited/VBN to/TO be/BE likened/VBN to/IN the/AT limpid/JJ green/JJ water/NN or/CC the/AT little/JJ fountain-falls/NNS or/CC the/AT green/JJ demon/NN imprisoned/VBN beyond/IN his/PP$ reach/NN ./.

He/PPS left/VBD the/AT pool/NN and/CC climbed/VBD the/AT steep/NN stone/NN stairs/NNS to/IN the/AT temple/NN ,/, and/CC the/AT sense/NN of/IN familiarity/NN with/IN the/AT place/NN would/MD not/* leave/VB him/PPO ./.

Into/IN a/AT little/JJ well/NN before/IN the/AT temple/NN he/PPS dropped/VBD a/AT hundred-yen/JJ coin/NN and/CC then/RB he/PPS had/HVD an/AT urge/NN to/TO sound/VB the/AT bell/NN before/IN the/AT temple/NN ,/, to/TO take/VB hold/NN of/IN the/AT rope/NN and/CC crash/VB it/PPO against/IN the/AT circle/NN of/IN bronze/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT black/JJ Fudo/NP seemed/VBD to/TO stare/VB rigidly/RB back/RB at/IN him/PPO and/CC Richard's/NP$ eyes/NNS were/BED caught/VBN by/IN the/AT Fudo's/NP$ in/IN fascination/NN ,/, and/CC then/JJ Richard/NP was/BEDZ shocked/VBN as/CS ,/, all/ABN at/IN once/RB ,/, flames/NNS shot/VBD out/RP from/IN the/AT sharp/JJ features/NNS of/IN Fudo's/NP$ face/NN and/CC there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT terrible/JJ metallic/JJ scraping/VBG sound/NN ,/, as/CS if/CS the/AT large/JJ statue/NN were/BED about/RB to/TO burst/VB from/IN some/DTI pressure/NN within/IN it/PPO ./.

Suddenly/RB he/PPS emptied/VBD his/PP$ pockets/NNS of/IN all/ABN his/PP$ coins/NNS and/CC dropped/VBD them/PPO into/IN the/AT box/NN before/IN the/AT seated/VBN Fudo/NP and/CC hurried/VBD back/RB down/IN both/ABX stairways/NNS and/CC away/RB from/IN the/AT temple/NN ,/, never/RB looking/VBG back/RB ./.

He/PPS walked/VBD all/ABN the/AT miles/NNS back/RB to/IN his/PP$ room/NN ./.

He/PPS seemed/VBD to/TO have/HV picked/VBN up/RP a/AT virus/NN that/DT day/NN ,/, because/CS the/AT next/AP morning/NN he/PPS had/HVD a/AT small/JJ cough/NN and/CC felt/VBD a/AT bit/NN hot/JJ ./.

He/PPS stayed/VBD home/NR ,/, reading/VBG and/CC refusing/VBG to/TO think/VB about/IN his/PP$ frightening/VBG experience/NN at/IN Ryusenji/NP ./.

The/AT cold/NN lingered/VBD ,/, making/VBG sleep/NN difficult/JJ that/DT night/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS remained/VBD in/IN bed/NN still/RB the/AT next/AP morning/NN ,/, now/RB unable/JJ to/TO keep/VB from/IN thinking/VBG about/IN the/AT inexplicable/JJ sight/NN of/IN burning/VBG metal/NN ,/, the/AT wretched/JJ sound/NN ,/, the/AT unbearable/JJ feeling/NN of/IN having/HVG been/BEN to/IN a/AT remote/JJ Tokyo/NP temple/NN at/IN some/DTI earlier/JJR time/NN in/IN his/PP$ life/NN ./.

All/ABN of/IN the/AT elements/NNS of/IN the/AT experience/NN were/BED impossible/JJ and/CC yet/RB the/AT reality/NN of/IN them/PPO was/BEDZ heavy/JJ upon/IN him/PPO and/CC he/PPS resolved/VBD never/RB again/RB to/TO visit/VB the/AT temple/NN at/IN Fudomae/NP ./.

The/AT boy/NN usually/RB was/BEDZ sent/VBN out/RP at/IN about/IN that/DT time/NN with/IN the/AT water/NN ,/, and/CC he/PPS always/RB dragged/VBD an/AT old/JJ snow-fence/NN lath/NN or/CC a/AT stick/NN along/RB ,/, to/TO play/VB with/IN ./.

He/PPS pretended/VBD that/CS the/AT lath/NN was/BEDZ a/AT tractor/NN and/CC he/PPS would/MD drag/VB it/PPO through/IN the/AT dirt/NN and/CC make/VB buzzing/VBG ,/, tractor/NN sounds/NNS with/IN his/PP$ lips/NNS ./.

I/PPSS almost/RB ran/VBD over/IN the/AT snake/NN before/CS I/PPSS could/MD stop/VB the/AT tractor/NN in/IN time/NN ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD turned/VBN at/IN the/AT corner/NN of/IN the/AT field/NN and/CC I/PPSS had/HVD to/TO look/VB back/RB to/TO raise/VB the/AT plow/NN and/CC then/RB to/TO drop/VB it/PPO again/RB into/IN the/AT earth/NN ,/, and/CC I/PPSS was/BEDZ thinking/VBG of/IN the/AT boy/NN and/CC the/AT water/NN anyway/RB ,/, and/CC when/WRB I/PPSS looked/VBD again/RB down/IN the/AT furrow/NN ,/, the/AT snake/NN was/BEDZ there/RB ./.

It/PPS lay/VBD half/ABN in/IN the/AT furrow/NN and/CC half/ABN out/RP ,/, and/CC the/AT front/JJ wheels/NNS had/HVD rolled/VBN nearly/RB up/IN to/IN it/PPO when/WRB I/PPSS put/VBD in/IN the/AT clutch/NN ./.

The/AT tractor/NN was/BEDZ heavily/RB loaded/VBN with/IN the/AT weight/NN of/IN the/AT plow/NN turning/VBG the/AT earth/NN ,/, and/CC the/AT tractor/NN stopped/VBD instantly/RB ./.

The/AT snake/NN slid/VBD slowly/RB and/CC with/IN great/JJ care/NN from/IN the/AT new/JJ ridge/NN the/AT plow/NN had/HVD made/VBN ,/, into/IN the/AT furrow/NN and/CC did/DOD not/* go/VB any/DTI further/RBR ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD never/RB liked/VBN snakes/NNS much/RB ,/, I/PPSS still/RB had/HVD that/DT kind/NN of/IN quick/JJ panic/NN that/WPS I'd/PPSS+HVD had/HVN as/CS a/AT child/NN whenever/WRB I/PPSS saw/VBD one/PN ,/, but/CC this/DT snake/NN was/BEDZ clean/JJ and/CC bright/JJ and/CC very/QL beautiful/JJ ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ multi-colored/JJ and/CC graceful/JJ and/CC he/PPS lay/VBD in/IN the/AT furrow/NN and/CC moved/VBD his/PP$ arched/VBN and/CC tapered/VBN head/NN only/RB so/QL slightly/RB ./.

Go/VB out/IN of/IN the/AT furrow/NN ,/, snake/NN ,/, I/PPSS said/VBD ,/, but/CC it/PPS did/DOD not/* move/VB at/IN all/ABN ./.

I/PPSS pulled/VBD the/AT throttle/NN of/IN the/AT tractor/NN in/RP and/CC out/RP ,/, hoping/VBG to/TO frighten/VB him/PPO with/IN the/AT noise/NN ,/, but/CC the/AT snake/NN only/RB flicked/VBD its/PP$ black/JJ ,/, forked/VBN tongue/NN and/CC faced/VBD the/AT huge/JJ tractor/NN wheel/NN ,/, without/IN fright/NN or/CC concern/NN ./.

I/PPSS let/VBD the/AT engine/NN idle/VB then/RB ,/, and/CC I/PPSS got/VBD down/RP and/CC went/VBD around/IN the/AT wheel/NN and/CC stood/VBD beside/IN it/PPO ./.

My/PP$ movement/NN did/DOD frighten/VB the/AT snake/NN and/CC it/PPS raised/VBD its/PP$ head/NN and/CC trailed/VBD delicately/RB a/AT couple/NN of/IN feet/NNS and/CC stopped/VBD again/RB ,/, and/CC its/PP$ tongue/NN was/BEDZ working/VBG very/QL rapidly/RB ./.

I/PPSS followed/VBD it/PPO ,/, looking/VBG at/IN the/AT brilliant/JJ colors/NNS on/IN its/PP$ tubular/JJ back/NN ,/, the/AT colors/NNS clear/VB and/CC sharp/JJ and/CC perfect/JJ ,/, in/IN orange/JJ and/CC green/JJ and/CC brown/JJ diamonds/NNS the/AT size/NN of/IN a/AT baby's/NN$ fist/NN down/IN its/PP$ back/NN ,/, and/CC the/AT diamonds/NNS were/BED set/VBN one/PN within/IN the/AT other/AP and/CC interlaced/VBN with/IN glistening/VBG jet-black/NN ./.

The/AT colors/NNS were/BED astonishing/JJ ,/, clear/JJ and/CC bright/JJ ,/, and/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ as/CS if/CS the/AT body/NN held/VBD a/AT fire/NN of/IN its/PP$ own/JJ ,/, and/CC the/AT colors/NNS came/VBD through/IN that/DT transparent/JJ flesh/NN and/CC skin/NN ,/, vivid/JJ and/CC alive/JJ and/CC warm/JJ ./.

The/AT eyes/NNS were/BED clear/JJ and/CC black/JJ and/CC the/AT slender/JJ body/NN was/BEDZ arched/VBN slightly/RB ./.

His/PP$ flat/JJ and/CC gracefully/RB tapered/VBN head/NN lifted/VBD as/CS I/PPSS looked/VBD at/IN him/PPO and/CC the/AT black/JJ tongue/NN slipped/VBD in/IN and/CC out/IN of/IN that/DT solemn/JJ mouth/NN ./.

You/PPSS beauty/NN ,/, I/PPSS said/VBD ,/, I/PPSS couldn't/MD* kill/VB you/PPO ./.

You/PPSS are/BER much/QL too/QL beautiful/JJ ./.

I/PPSS had/HVD killed/VBN snakes/NNS before/IN ,/, when/WRB I/PPSS was/BEDZ younger/JJR ,/, but/CC there/EX had/HVD been/BEN no/AT animal/NN like/CS this/DT one/PN ,/, and/CC I/PPSS knew/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ unthinkable/JJ that/CS an/AT animal/NN such/JJ as/CS that/DT should/MD die/VB ./.

I/PPSS picked/VBD him/PPO up/RP ,/, and/CC the/AT length/NN of/IN him/PPO arched/VBN very/QL carefully/RB and/CC gracefully/RB and/CC only/RB a/AT little/QL wildly/RB ,/, and/CC I/PPSS could/MD feel/VB the/AT coolness/NN of/IN that/DT radiant/JJ ,/, fire-colored/JJ body/NN ,/, like/CS splendid/JJ ice/NN ,/, and/CC I/PPSS knew/VBD that/CS he/PPS had/HVD eaten/VBN only/RB recently/RB because/CS there/EX were/BED two/CD whole/JJ and/CC solid/JJ little/JJ lumps/NNS in/IN the/AT forepart/NN of/IN him/PPO ,/, like/CS fieldmice/NNS swallowed/VBN whole/JJ might/MD make/VB ./.

The/AT body/NN caressed/VBD through/IN my/PP$ hands/NNS like/CS cool/JJ satin/NN ,/, and/CC my/PP$ hands/NNS ,/, usually/RB tanned/VBN and/CC dark/JJ ,/, were/BED pale/JJ beside/IN it/PPO ,/, and/CC I/PPSS asked/VBD it/PPO where/WRB the/AT fire/NN colors/NNS could/MD come/VB from/IN the/AT coolness/NN of/IN that/DT body/NN ./.

For/IN some/DTI reason/NN ,/, this/DT ellipsis/NN in/IN the/AT conversation/NN spread/VBD until/CS it/PPS swallowed/VBD up/RP every/AT other/AP topic/NN ./.

At/IN last/RB there/EX was/BEDZ a/AT void/NN no/AT one/PN could/MD fill/VB ./.

The/AT Brainards/NPS went/VBD home/NR early/RB ./.

At/IN once/RB ./.

He/PPS considered/VBD the/AT sober/JJ possibility/NN ./.

In/IN his/PP$ head/NN was/BEDZ the/AT echo/NN of/IN those/DTS titters/NNS with/IN Anthea/NP ./.

There/EX was/BEDZ something/PN about/IN private/JJ feminine/JJ whisperings/NNS which/WDT always/RB made/VBD him/PPO feel/VB scabrous/JJ and/CC unclean/JJ ./.

He/PPS remembered/VBD his/PP$ mother/NN gossiping/VBG with/IN her/PP$ neighborhood/NN women/NNS friends/NNS ,/, lowering/VBG her/PP$ voice/NN to/IN a/AT penetrating/JJ hoarseness/NN which/WDT might/MD be/BE trusted/VBN to/TO carry/VB to/IN the/AT head/NN of/IN the/AT stairs/NNS ,/, where/WRB he/PPS crouched/VBD listening/VBG ./.

She/PPS was/BEDZ talking/VBG about/IN him/PPO that/DT time/NN ,/, because/CS he/PPS had/HVD done/VBN some/DTI bad/JJ thing/NN ,/, something/PN she/PPS disliked/VBD ,/, but/CC ``/`` Afterwards/RB Martin/NP said/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ sorry/JJ ./.

He/PPS apologized/VBD so/QL sweetly/RB ,/, I/PPSS couldn't/MD* keep/VB being/BEG annoyed/VBN with/IN him/PPO ''/'' ./.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* even/RB true/JJ that/CS he'd/PPS+HVD said/VBN he/PPS was/BEDZ sorry/JJ that/DT time/NN ;/. ;/.

But/CC his/PP$ mother/NN told/VBD the/AT story/NN over/RP and/CC over/RP ,/, till/CS her/PP$ ``/`` Martin/NP said/VBD he/PPS was/BEDZ sorry/JJ ''/'' was/BEDZ as/QL much/AP a/AT part/NN of/IN her/PPO as/CS the/AT shape/NN of/IN her/PP$ thin/JJ ,/, pallid/JJ ears/NNS ./.

The/AT battle/NN had/HVD to/TO be/BE fought/VBN ./.

Let/VB the/AT best/JJT sex/NN win/VB ./.

But/CC his/PP$ resolution/NN hardly/RB seemed/VBD to/TO help/VB ./.

If/CS the/AT situation/NN had/HVD been/BEN bad/JJ ,/, it/PPS now/RB got/VBD worse/JJR ./.

About/IN this/DT time/NN people/NNS began/VBD ``/`` dropping/VBG in/RP ''/'' ,/, considering/IN that/CS the/AT newly/RB married/VBN had/HVD been/BEN left/VBN alone/RB long/JJ enough/QLP ./.

Angrily/RB Martin/NP wished/VBD they/PPSS had/HVD delayed/VBN the/AT wedding/NN and/CC gone/VBN on/IN a/AT trip/NN --/-- preferably/RB one/PN that/WPS lasted/VBD months/NNS --/-- instead/RB of/IN deciding/VBG not/* to/TO postpone/VB the/AT date/NN until/CS he/PPS could/MD get/VB away/RB ./.

Here/RB they/PPSS were/BED at/IN the/AT mercy/NN of/IN anyone/PN who/WPS chose/VBD to/TO come/VB by/RB ./.

These/DTS stray/JJ people/NNS nearly/RB always/RB insisted/VBD on/IN Dolores/NP showing/VBG them/PPO around/IN the/AT apartment/NN ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/AT tours/NNS of/IN inspection/NN included/VBD the/AT ever-present/JJ shorts/NNS ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ curious/JJ how/WRB the/AT different/JJ visitors/NNS took/VBD this/DT ./.

Quite/QL a/AT few/AP laughed/VBN ./.

To/IN them/PPO all/ABN Dolores/NP told/VBD a/AT lighthearted/JJ and/CC witty/JJ tale/NN ./.

``/`` It's/PPS+BEZ a/AT little/AP contest/NN Martin/NP and/CC I/PPSS have/HV ''/'' ,/, she/PPS would/MD begin/VB gaily/RB ,/, carrying/VBG the/AT anecdote/NN through/IN a/AT frothy/JJ and/CC deceptive/JJ course/NN ./.

``/`` You/PPSS were/BED in/IN a/AT hurry/NN ,/, weren't/BED* you/PPSS ''/'' ?/. ?/.

Dolores/NP smiled/VBD ;/. ;/.

she/PPS let/VBD the/AT interpretation/NN stand/VB ./.

Now/RB Martin/NP heard/VBD himself/PPL give/VB a/AT snort/NN of/IN mock/JJ good/JJ nature/NN ./.

With/IN her/PP$ eyes/NNS Dolores/NP dared/VBD him/PPO for/IN the/AT truth/NN ,/, ready/JJ to/TO begin/VB :/: It's/PPS+BEZ a/AT little/AP contest/NN --/--

Never/RB again/RB did/DOD he/PPS enter/VB into/IN the/AT ritual/NN of/IN showing/VBG the/AT apartment/NN ./.

They/PPSS kept/VBD up/RP a/AT rigid/JJ pretense/NN of/IN speaking/VBG relations/NNS ./.

But/CC Martin/NP seldom/RB felt/VBD the/AT impulse/NN to/TO talk/VB about/IN anything/PN ./.

What/WDT to/TO talk/VB about/IN ?/. ?/.

Dolores/NP kept/VBD picking/VBG up/RP any/DTI of/IN his/PP$ clothes/NNS (/( except/IN the/AT fatal/JJ shorts/NNS )/) which/WDT he/PPS left/VBD about/RB ,/, but/CC he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN robbed/VBN of/IN pleasure/NN in/IN scattering/VBG his/PP$ possessions/NNS ./.

He/PPS fell/VBD into/IN the/AT habit/NN of/IN putting/VBG his/PP$ clothes/NNS in/IN drawers/NNS and/CC closets/NNS ,/, so/CS his/PP$ life/NN might/MD impinge/VB as/QL little/QL as/CS possible/JJ on/IN hers/PP$$ ./.

The/AT shorts/NNS alone/RB remained/VBD ./.

In/IN his/PP$ moments/NNS of/IN worst/JJT agony/NN ,/, Martin/NP imagined/VBD what/WDT his/PP$ friends/NNS were/BED saying/VBG ./.

The/AT sound/NN of/IN their/PP$ amazement/NN ./.

Bizarre/JJ :/: He/PPS could/MD hear/VB the/AT word/NN ./.

The/AT most/QL bizarre/JJ situation/NN ./.

We/PPSS were/BED up/RP to/TO visit/VB them/PPO and/CC

He/PPS had/HVD thought/VBN her/PPO exactly/RB what/WDT he/PPS wanted/VBD ./.

Six/CD weeks/NNS of/IN marriage/NN and/CC I'm/PPSS+BEM using/VBG the/AT past/JJ tense/NN ,/, he/PPS told/VBD himself/PPL furiously/RB ./.

Pursuing/VBG his/PP$ idea/NN ,/, he/PPS saw/VBD that/CS it/PPS would/MD be/BE impossible/JJ to/TO leave/VB her/PPO now/RB ./.

Everyone/PN would/MD know/VB why/WRB ;/. ;/.

he/PPS would/MD cut/VB a/AT supremely/QL ridiculous/JJ figure/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ trapped/VBN ./.

Day/NN and/CC night/NN Martin/NP could/MD not/* drag/VB his/PP$ mind/NN from/IN the/AT dilemma/NN he/PPS had/HVD made/VBN for/IN himself/PPL ./.

His/PP$ mind/NN scurried/VBD frantically/RB ,/, seeking/VBG an/AT exit/NN ./.

Alternately/RB he/PPS had/HVD periods/NNS of/IN hostile/JJ defeatism/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PPS determined/VBD sullenly/RB ,/, morosely/RB ,/, to/TO live/VB out/RP his/PP$ life/NN in/IN this/DT fashion/NN ./.

Nothing/PN would/MD change/VB ,/, nothing/PN would/MD ever/RB change/VB ./.

When/WRB the/AT solution/NN finally/RB came/VBD to/IN him/PPO ,/, one/CD night/NN while/CS he/PPS was/BEDZ in/IN bed/NN ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ so/QL shaken/VBN by/IN its/PP$ simplicity/NN that/CS he/PPS could/MD only/RB wonder/VB why/WRB it/PPS had/HVD not/* occurred/VBN to/IN him/PPO before/RB ./.

In/IN a/AT frenzy/NN of/IN excitement/NN ,/, he/PPS considered/VBD his/PP$ plan/NN ./.

Beside/IN his/PP$ shorts/NNS ,/, he/PPS would/MD place/VB something/PN of/IN hers/PP$$ ./.

Instantaneously/RB he/PPS would/MD have/HV won/VBN an/AT immeasurable/JJ moral/JJ victory/NN ,/, for/CS if/CS she/PPS picked/VBD up/RP ,/, say/VB ,/, a/AT pair/NN of/IN her/PP$ panties/NNS ,/, she/PPS might/MD just/RB as/QL well/RB lift/VB his/PP$ shorts/NNS lying/VBG alongside/RB --/-- the/AT expenditure/NN of/IN energy/NN was/BEDZ almost/RB the/AT same/AP ./.

He/PPS felt/VBD that/CS it/PPS would/MD be/BE a/AT particular/JJ humiliation/NN to/IN Dolores/NP to/TO pick/VB up/RP her/PP$ own/JJ underwear/NN which/WDT he/PPS had/HVD laid/VBN on/IN the/AT floor/NN ./.

Furthermore/RB ,/, he/PPS could/MD go/VB on/IN repeating/VBG the/AT maneuver/NN endlessly/RB :/: every/AT time/NN he/PPS went/VBD in/IN the/AT bedroom/NN ,/, he/PPS could/MD drop/VB a/AT slip/NN or/CC a/AT brassiere/NN ,/, or/CC maybe/RB a/AT girdle/NN ,/, next/IN to/IN his/PP$ shorts/NNS ./.

Sooner/RBR or/CC later/RBR ,/, Dolores/NP would/MD crack/VB ./.

On/IN the/AT other/AP hand/NN ,/, if/CS she/PPS didn't/DOD* remove/VB her/PP$ own/JJ things/NNS ,/, it/PPS would/MD be/BE difficult/JJ to/TO explain/VB to/IN the/AT parade/NN of/IN guests/NNS which/WDT traversed/VBD the/AT apartment/NN ./.

Martin/NP guessed/VBD that/CS Dolores/NP would/MD not/* be/BE so/QL eager/JJ to/TO tell/VB the/AT next/AP installment/NN of/IN her/PP$ story/NN ./.

The/AT tale/NN ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD ,/, would/MD become/VB less/QL gay/JJ ./.

She/PPS had/HVD used/VBN his/PP$ rumpled/VBN shorts/NNS as/CS the/AT very/AP image/NN of/IN his/PP$ childishness/NN ,/, his/PP$ lack/NN of/IN control/NN ,/, his/PP$ general/JJ male/NN looseness/NN ,/, while/CS she/PPS remained/VBD cool/JJ ,/, airy/JJ ,/, and/CC untouched/JJ ,/, the/AT charming/JJ teacher/NN who/WPS disciplined/VBD an/AT unruly/JJ body/NN ./.

To/TO have/HV her/PP$ underclothes/NNS linked/VBN with/IN his/PP$$ on/IN the/AT floor/NN would/MD draw/VB her/PPO visibly/RB into/IN a/AT struggle/NN both/ABX bitter/JJ and/CC absurd/JJ ./.

Something/PN in/IN the/AT back/NN of/IN his/PP$ mind/NN was/BEDZ aware/JJ that/CS the/AT magnificence/NN of/IN the/AT plan/NN lay/VBD in/IN his/PP$ faith/NN ,/, that/CS the/AT idea/NN would/MD work/VB because/CS he/PPS believed/VBD in/IN it/PPO ,/, since/CS his/PP$ courage/NN and/CC virility/NN were/BED involved/VBN ,/, because/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ truly/RB his/PP$$ ./.

The/AT knowledge/NN kept/VBD him/PPO from/IN analyzing/VBG his/PP$ scheme/NN to/IN death/NN ,/, and/CC took/VBD him/PPO through/IN the/AT last/AP hours/NNS of/IN that/DT night/NN in/IN a/AT peace/NN of/IN exalted/VBN fanaticism/NN ./.

The/AT next/AP morning/NN ,/, while/CS Dolores/NP was/BEDZ out/IN of/IN the/AT room/NN ,/, he/PPS went/VBD to/IN her/PP$ bureau/NN drawer/NN ,/, took/VBD out/RP a/AT pair/NN of/IN nylon/NN lace/NN pants/NNS ,/, and/CC tenderly/RB dropped/VBD them/PPO next/IN to/IN his/PP$ shorts/NNS ./.

He/PPS sat/VBD down/RP on/IN the/AT bed/NN ./.

In/IN a/AT surprisingly/RB short/JJ time/NN ,/, Dolores/NP appeared/VBD ./.

To/IN his/PP$ delight/NN ,/, her/PP$ eyes/NNS focused/VBD at/IN once/RB upon/IN the/AT two/CD garments/NNS ./.

Slowly/RB and/CC deliberately/RB she/PPS reached/VBD down/RP and/CC touched/VBD the/AT lace/NN with/IN her/PP$ fingers/NNS ,/, then/RB hesitated/VBD for/IN about/RB a/AT second/OD ./.

Ah/UH ,/, he/PPS thought/VBD ,/, she's/PPS+BEZ going/VBG through/IN the/AT chain/NN of/IN reasoning/VBG which/WDT says/VBZ she/PPS might/MD really/RB just/RB as/QL well/RB pick/VB up/RP my/PP$ shorts/NNS too/RB ./.

He/PPS saw/VBD that/CS in/IN a/AT moment/NN she/PPS had/HVD grasped/VBN all/ABN the/AT implications/NNS of/IN a/AT plot/NN which/WDT had/HVD been/BEN weeks/NNS in/IN occurring/VBG to/IN him/PPO ./.

Extending/VBG her/PP$ fingers/NNS another/DT inch/NN ,/, she/PPS caught/VBD up/RP the/AT shorts/NNS ,/, and/CC swiftly/RB left/VBD the/AT room/NN ./.

She/PPS did/DOD not/* look/VB at/IN him/PPO ,/, but/CC he/PPS noticed/VBD that/CS her/PP$ face/NN was/BEDZ flushed/VBN and/CC her/PP$ eyes/NNS unsteady/JJ ./.

They/PPSS breakfasted/VBD together/RB ,/, but/CC Martin/NP did/DOD not/* refer/VB to/IN his/PP$ triumph/NN ,/, and/CC Dolores/NP found/VBD a/AT great/JJ deal/NN to/TO do/DO in/IN the/AT kitchen/NN ,/, bobbing/VBG up/RP and/CC down/RP from/IN the/AT table/NN so/CS that/DT talk/NN was/BEDZ impossible/JJ ./.

Well/UH ,/, Martin/NP thought/VBD ,/, That'll/DT+MD save/VB ./.

He/PPS left/VBD for/IN work/NN in/IN high/JJ spirits/NNS ./.

As/CS he/PPS relaxed/VBD that/DT day/NN ,/, Martin/NP realized/VBD how/WRB tense/JJ he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN these/DTS past/JJ weeks/NNS ./.

He/PPS found/VBD that/CS he/PPS no/AT longer/JJR hated/VBD Dolores/NP (/( he/PPS knew/VBD how/WRB much/AP he/PPS had/HVD hated/VBN her/PPO )/) ,/, and/CC he/PPS was/BEDZ surprised/VBN at/IN a/AT resurgence/NN of/IN an/AT affectionate/JJ feeling/NN ./.

``/`` Good/JJ old/JJ A-Z/NN ''/'' ,/, Cap/NP said/VBD ./.

``/`` You/PPSS know/VB ,/, I've/PPSS+HV got/VBN one/CD of/IN your/PP$ cars/NNS at/IN home/NR ./.

Once/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ ,/, William/NP thought/VBD ./.

But/CC not/* any/DTI more/RBR ./.

A/AT rush/NN of/IN memory/NN swept/VBD him/PPO back/RB ,/, and/CC he/PPS forgot/VBD Cap/NP ./.

How/WRB did/DOD he/PPS start/VB on/IN such/ABL a/AT ride/NN to/IN brief/JJ glory/NN ?/. ?/.

Simply/RB enough/QLP ,/, through/IN the/AT inadvertent/JJ agency/NN of/IN his/PP$ brother-in-law/NN ./.

General/NN Hershey's/NP$ draft/NN and/CC Doc/NP Eddyman/NP and/CC Cap/NP were/BED responsible/JJ for/IN his/PP$ first/OD eminence/NN ,/, but/CC Fearless/JJ Freddy/NP Bryan/NP could/MD take/VB credit/NN ,/, if/CS he/PPS cared/VBD to/IN (/( and/CC he/PPS did/DOD )/) ,/, for/IN the/AT second/OD time/NN ./.

Freddy/NP needed/VBD a/AT job/NN ,/, having/HVG been/BEN detached/VBN from/IN a/AT rather/QL dangerous/JJ career/NN in/IN real/JJ estate/NN and/CC skyscraper/NN financing/VBG by/IN Gerry/NP ,/, and/CC it/PPS was/BEDZ up/IN to/IN Arthur/NP Willis/NP to/TO provide/VB him/PPO with/IN one/PN ./.

Mr./NP Willis/NP bought/VBD Zenith/NN Plastic/NN Products/NNS ,/, a/AT skeleton/NN corporation/NN of/IN sorts/NNS which/WDT had/HVD undergone/VBN many/AP vicissitudes/NNS and/CC whose/WP$ principal/JJS assets/NNS were/BED a/AT couple/NN of/IN electronics/NN plants/NNS on/IN Long/JJ Island/NN engaged/VBD in/IN working/VBG out/RP government/NN contracts/NNS ,/, and/CC installed/VBD Freddy/NP in/IN an/AT executive/NN position/NN ./.

Shortly/RB after/RB ,/, Freddy/NP had/HVD his/PP$ usual/JJ proliferation/NN of/IN bold/JJ ideas/NNS ./.

Willis/NP listened/VBD patiently/RB ,/, and/CC once/RB in/IN a/AT while/NN William/NP was/BEDZ exposed/VBN to/IN them/PPO at/IN a/AT family/NN gathering/NN ;/. ;/.

he/PPS generally/RB heard/VBD Freddy's/NP$ suggestions/NNS without/IN interest/NN ,/, being/BEG absorbed/VBN by/IN his/PP$ own/JJ prospering/VBG concerns/NNS ./.

Probably/RB Mr./NP Willis/NP was/BEDZ influenced/VBN toward/IN deeper/JJR involvement/NN by/IN familial/JJ loyalty/NN and/CC a/AT concern/NN for/IN his/PP$ grandchildren/NNS ./.

Gerry/NP began/VBD to/TO aid/VB Freddy/NP with/IN her/PP$ father/NN ,/, prodded/VBN ,/, no/AT doubt/NN ,/, by/IN Joan's/NP$ open/JJ contempt/NN for/IN Freddy/NP and/CC William's/NP$ irritating/JJ competency/NN ./.

Another/DT factor/NN must/MD have/HV been/BEN the/AT eventual/JJ disposal/NN of/IN Willis'/NP$ fortune/NN ;/. ;/.

she/PPS unquestionably/RB assumed/VBD that/CS the/AT more/RBR he/PPS was/BEDZ entwined/VBN with/IN Freddy/NP ,/, the/AT more/QL likely/RB he/PPS was/BEDZ to/TO reward/VB Freddy/NP richly/RB upon/IN his/PP$ death/NN ./.

Whatever/WDT the/AT reasons/NNS ,/, Willis/NP and/CC Bryan/NP started/VBD expanding/VBG Zenith/NN ./.

They/PPSS acquired/VBD another/DT electronics/NN factory/NN ,/, a/AT specialized/VBN ceramics/NN company/NN ,/, an/AT organization/NN that/WPS built/VBD --/-- very/QL experimentally/RB --/-- high-speed/NN research/NN calculators/NNS ./.

Since/CS they/PPSS were/BED hunting/VBG for/IN national/JJ defense/NN contracts/NNS ,/, Adam/NP Herberet/NP ,/, a/AT man/NN of/IN surprising/VBG resources/NNS ,/, entered/VBD the/AT combination/NN as/CS a/AT silent/JJ partner/NN because/RB of/IN his/PP$ political/JJ connections/NNS ./.

Feeling/VBG his/PP$ power/NN ,/, Freddy/NP looked/VBD for/IN additional/JJ worlds/NNS to/TO conquer/VB ./.

Heavy/JJ industry/NN ,/, slanted/VBN toward/IN inexhaustible/JJ government/NN coffers/NNS ,/, attracted/VBD him/PPO ./.

The/AT Allstates/NPS Auto/NN Company/NN ,/, a/AT medium-sized/JJ firm/NN which/WDT manufactured/VBD four-wheel-drive/NN vehicles/NNS and/CC other/AP off-road/JJ equipment/NN ,/, had/HVD recently/RB constructed/VBN an/AT over-large/JJ ,/, modern/JJ plant/NN in/IN a/AT burst/NN of/IN misguided/VBN optimism/NN ./.

At/IN that/DT point/NN William/NP came/VBD into/IN the/AT picture/NN ./.

Although/CS not/* much/RB desiring/VBG the/AT account/NN ,/, he/PPS had/HVD been/BEN appointed/VBN advertising/VBG head/NN of/IN Zenith/NN ./.

Freed/VBN of/IN routine/NN by/IN having/HVG his/PP$ own/JJ firm/NN and/CC a/AT complaisant/JJ partner/NN ,/, his/PP$ work/NN in/IN New/JJ York/NP had/HVD given/VBN him/PPO a/AT broader/JJR overall/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN business/NN administration/NN and/CC corporate/JJ structure/NN ;/. ;/.

and/CC if/CS he/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* entirely/RB committed/VBN to/IN what/WDT he/PPS did/DOD ,/, he/PPS was/BEDZ at/IN least/AP fascinated/VBD by/IN the/AT chance/NN of/IN wider/JJR opportunities/NNS ./.

Mr./NP Willis/NP ,/, eager/JJ to/TO have/HV him/PPO allied/VBN with/IN the/AT family/NN ,/, wanted/VBD advice/NN beyond/IN the/AT confines/NNS of/IN his/PP$ field/NN ,/, and/CC William/NP set/VBD out/RP on/IN a/AT serious/JJ study/NN of/IN the/AT situation/NN ,/, including/IN trips/NNS to/IN Wisconsin/NP and/CC Washington/NP ./.

The/AT searching/VBG party/NN consisted/VBD of/IN the/AT police/NN captain/NN ,/, Welch/NP ,/, Barco/NP ,/, policemen/NNS with/IN shovels/NNS ,/, newspaper/NN reporters/NNS ,/, and/CC cameramen/NNS ./.

Barco/NP ,/, his/PP$ state/NN of/IN apprehension/NN gone/VBN ,/, never/RB to/TO return/VB ,/, had/HVD assumed/VBN a/AT matter-of-factness/NN which/WDT remained/VBD his/PP$ principal/JJS attitude/NN from/IN that/DT time/NN on/RP ./.

He/PPS directed/VBD the/AT cortege/NN of/IN autos/NNS to/IN the/AT sand/NN dunes/NNS near/IN Santa/NP Monica/NP ./.

Stopping/VBG the/AT cars/NNS at/IN a/AT fork/NN in/IN the/AT road/NN ,/, he/PPS got/VBD out/RP ,/, paced/VBD off/RP a/AT certain/JJ distance/NN to/IN a/AT spot/NN between/IN two/CD shrub-covered/JJ sand/NN hills/NNS ,/, and/CC indicated/VBD a/AT location/NN ./.

Orders/NNS were/BED given/VBN to/TO dig/VB ./.

Nothing/PN was/BEDZ found/VBN ./.

Welch/NP was/BEDZ worried/VBN ./.

The/AT police/NN captain/NN chortled/VBD ./.

The/AT newspaper/NN boys/NNS cracked/VBD jokes/NNS and/CC again/RB Barco's/NP$ pride/NN was/BEDZ aroused/VBN ./.

With/IN greater/JJR precision/NN he/PPS again/RB paced/VBD off/RP a/AT location/NN ,/, this/DT time/NN a/AT little/QL more/RBR to/IN the/AT left/NR ./.

With/IN quibs/NNS and/CC gibes/NNS ,/, the/AT policemen/NNS again/RB started/VBD digging/VBG ./.

Welch/NP was/BEDZ on/IN edge/NN ./.

The/AT captain/NN was/BEDZ remarking/VBG that/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT nice/JJ day/NN for/IN a/AT picnic/NN when/WRB finally/RB one/CD of/IN the/AT shovels/NNS struck/VBD an/AT object/NN ./.

``/`` There's/EX+BEZ something/PN here/RB ''/'' !/. !/.

Said/VBD the/AT digger/NN ./.

Joking/VBG stopped/VBD and/CC everyone/PN gathered/VBD around/RB ./.

The/AT digger/NN ,/, thrusting/VBG about/RB with/IN his/PP$ shovel/NN ,/, now/RB raised/VBD into/IN view/NN a/AT package/NN crudely/RB wrapped/VBN in/IN one/CD of/IN the/AT murderer's/NN$ Hollywood/NP sport/NN shirts/NNS ./.

Although/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ a/AT mere/JJ fragment/NN of/IN the/AT victim's/NN$ remains/NNS ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ enough/AP ./.

Welch/NP was/BEDZ wild/JJ with/IN delight/NN ./.

His/PP$ elation/NN grew/VBD as/CS Barco's/NP$ seven/CD disclosures/NNS brought/VBD to/IN light/NN one/CD reward/NN after/IN another/DT ./.

Now/RB did/DOD Welch/NP truly/RB become/VB the/AT man/NN of/IN the/AT hour/NN ,/, and/CC everything/PN that/CS followed/VBD in/IN the/AT procedure/NN of/IN Justice/NN was/BEDZ a/AT new/JJ triumph/NN for/IN him/PPO ./.

It/PPS went/VBD to/IN his/PP$ head/NN ,/, and/CC his/PP$ ambition/NN increased/VBD ./.

It/PPS was/BEDZ apparent/JJ that/CS Welch/NP was/BEDZ in/IN cahoots/NNS with/IN Marshall/NP and/CC would/MD use/VB his/PP$ power/NN as/CS D.A./NP to/TO drag/VB every/AT possible/JJ sensation/NN into/IN the/AT case/NN ./.

Every/AT new/JJ scandal/NN which/WDT would/MD provide/VB more/AP ``/`` copy/NN ''/'' for/IN Marshall's/NP$ pen/NN would/MD thus/RB mean/VB more/AP publicity/NN for/IN Welch/NP ./.

I/PPSS knew/VBD that/CS both/ABX these/DTS cynics/NNS were/BED waiting/VBG with/IN impatience/NN for/IN the/AT dramatic/JJ moment/NN when/WRB Viola/NP was/BEDZ called/VBN to/IN the/AT stand/NN ./.

Once/RB there/RB ,/, the/AT D.A./NP with/IN devilish/JJ cleverness/NN would/MD provide/VB Marshall/NP with/IN headlines/NNS :/: ``/`` Viola's/NP$ Multiple/JJ Romances/NNS ''/'' ``/`` Viola/NP Lake/NP an/AT Addict/NN ''/'' ``/`` Downfall/NN of/IN Another/DT Film/NN Idol/NN ''/'' !/. !/.

It/PPS would/MD be/BE fine/JJ publicity/NN for/IN the/AT man/NN who/WPS was/BEDZ willing/JJ to/TO walk/VB to/IN the/AT mayor's/NN$ throne/NN over/IN the/AT broken/VBN reputation/NN of/IN a/AT helpless/JJ girl/NN !/. !/.

I/PPSS studied/VBD Welch/NP closely/RB as/CS the/AT trial/NN progressed/VBD for/IN any/DTI hint/NN which/WDT might/MD give/VB me/PPO a/AT lead/NN as/IN to/IN how/WRB he/PPS might/MD be/BE thwarted/VBN ./.

It/PPS wasn't/BEDZ* long/JJ before/CS I/PPSS sensed/VBD that/CS there/EX was/BEDZ something/PN deeper/JJR than/IN overvaulting/JJ ambition/NN back/RB of/IN his/PP$ desire/NN for/IN Viola's/NP$ destruction/NN ./.

He/PPS was/BEDZ bitter/JJ and/CC resentful/JJ toward/IN her/PPO ,/, personally/RB resentful/JJ ./.

A/AT dreadful/JJ fear/NN entered/VBD my/PP$ consciousness/NN that/CS perhaps/RB he/PPS had/HVD entertained/VBN aspirations/NNS toward/IN Viola's/NP$ favors/NNS --/-- or/CC ,/, even/RB more/QL serious/JJ perhaps/RB ,/, that/CS he/PPS had/HVD attained/VBN a/AT share/NN of/IN them/PPO and/CC had/HVD then/RB been/BEN superseded/VBN by/IN some/DTI luckier/JJR chap/NN ./.

I/PPSS did/DOD not/* rest/VB until/CS I/PPSS had/HVD tracked/VBN the/AT mystery/NN down/RP ./.

Well/UH ,/, here/RB it/PPS is/BEZ ./.

One/CD day/NN over/IN a/AT year/NN before/RB ,/, there/EX had/HVD been/BEN a/AT cocktail/NN party/NN in/IN an/AT apartment/NN of/IN a/AT downtown/NR hotel/NN ./.

Viola/NP had/HVD been/BEN urged/VBN to/TO attend/VB ,/, by/IN telephone/NN ,/, and/CC not/* knowing/VBG the/AT host/NN or/CC the/AT character/NN of/IN the/AT party/NN ,/, she/PPS had/HVD gone/VBN ./.

She/PPS arrived/VBD late/RB and/CC as/CS she/PPS entered/VBD the/AT party/NN ,/, noted/VBD that/CS gentlemen/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO be/BE in/IN the/AT majority/NN ;/. ;/.

the/AT air/NN was/BEDZ thick/JJ with/IN smoke/NN ,/, empty/JJ bottles/NNS were/BED in/IN evidence/NN ,/, and/CC several/AP of/IN the/AT guests/NNS were/BED somewhat/RB the/AT worse/JJR for/IN liquor/NN ./.

Naturally/RB ,/, Viola/NP had/HVD no/AT wish/NN to/TO remain/VB ,/, but/CC she/PPS felt/VBD she/PPS couldn't/MD* leave/VB so/QL soon/RB after/IN her/PP$ arrival/NN ,/, in/IN all/ABN politeness/NN to/TO her/PP$ host/NN ./.

And/CC it/PPS so/QL happened/VBD that/CS adjacent/JJ to/IN a/AT couch/NN on/IN which/WDT she/PPS had/HVD taken/VBN refuge/NN was/BEDZ a/AT small/JJ table/NN on/IN which/WDT she/PPS noted/VBD a/AT vase/NN of/IN red/JJ rosebuds/NNS ;/. ;/.

while/CS projecting/VBG from/IN beneath/IN the/AT couch/NN were/BED a/AT pair/NN of/IN feet/NNS which/WDT ,/, as/CS Fate/NN would/MD have/HV it/PPO ,/, belonged/VBD to/IN District/NN Attorney/NN Welch/NP ./.

As/CS Viola/NP sat/VBD there/RB ,/, a/AT playful/JJ impulse/NN overcame/VBD her/PPO to/TO remove/VB the/AT shoes/NNS and/CC socks/NNS from/IN the/AT unidentified/JJ feet/NNS and/CC ,/, as/CS a/AT prank/NN ,/, insert/VB rosebuds/NNS between/IN the/AT toes/NNS ./.

A/AT little/AP later/RBR the/AT district/NN attorney/NN woke/VBD up/RP ,/, emerged/VBD from/IN under/IN the/AT couch/NN ,/, looked/VBD at/IN his/PP$ watch/NN ,/, and/CC realized/VBD he/PPS had/HVD an/AT engagement/NN that/DT very/AP hour/NN to/TO address/VB a/AT meeting/NN of/IN the/AT Culture/NN Forum/NN on/IN ``/`` The/AT Civic/JJ Spirit/NN of/IN the/AT Southland/NP ''/'' ,/, in/IN the/AT Byzantine/JJ room/NN of/IN the/AT hotel/NN where/WRB his/PP$ wife/NN ,/, as/CS president/NN of/IN the/AT forum/NN ,/, was/BEDZ to/TO preside/VB ./.

He/PPS made/VBD his/PP$ way/NN to/IN his/PP$ host's/NN$ bedroom/NN where/WRB he/PPS carefully/RB brushed/VBD himself/PPL off/RP ,/, neatly/RB arranged/VBD his/PP$ hair/NN ,/, and/CC painstakingly/RB selected/VBD his/PP$ hat/NN from/IN the/AT many/AP on/IN the/AT bed/NN ./.

Then/RB ,/, noting/VBG neither/CC the/AT absence/NN of/IN his/PP$ footwear/NN nor/CC the/AT presence/NN of/IN the/AT rosebuds/NNS ,/, he/PPS made/VBD his/PP$ way/NN to/IN the/AT Byzantine/JJ room/NN and/CC ,/, with/IN his/PP$ usual/JJ dignity/NN ,/, mounted/VBD the/AT rostrum/NN ./.

The/AT effect/NN on/IN the/AT intellectuals/NNS among/IN his/PP$ audience/NN may/MD well/RB be/BE imagined/VBN ./.

The/AT incident/NN ,/, aside/RB from/IN reflecting/VBG on/IN Welch's/NP$ political/JJ career/NN ,/, had/HVD all/ABN but/IN wrecked/VBN his/PP$ home/NR life/NN ./.

He/PPS never/RB rested/VBD until/CS he/PPS discovered/VBD who/WPS the/AT culprit/NN was/BEDZ ,/, and/CC when/WRB he/PPS did/DOD ,/, he/PPS vowed/VBD vengeance/NN on/IN Viola/NP Lake/NP if/CS ever/RB the/AT chance/NN came/VBD his/PP$ way/NN ./.

And/CC here/RB it/PPS was/BEDZ !/. !/.

By/IN such/JJ innocent/JJ actions/NNS are/BER human/JJ tragedies/NNS sometimes/RB set/VBN in/IN motion/NN ./.

During/IN these/DTS first/OD days/NNS of/IN the/AT trial/NN I/PPSS didn't/DOD* have/HV as/QL much/AP time/NN to/TO commiserate/VB with/IN Viola/NP as/CS I/PPSS should/MD have/HV liked/VBN ./.

In/IN the/AT first/OD place/NN ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ difficult/JJ for/IN us/PPO to/TO meet/VB ./.

We/PPSS couldn't/MD* be/BE seen/VBN together/RB ,/, for/IN the/AT tongue/NN of/IN Scandal/NN was/BEDZ ever/RB ready/JJ to/TO link/VB our/PP$ names/NNS ,/, and/CC the/AT tongue/NN of/IN Scandal/NN finds/VBZ but/CC one/CD thing/NN to/TO say/VB of/IN the/AT association/NN of/IN a/AT man/NN with/IN a/AT girl/NN ,/, no/AT matter/NN how/QL innocent/JJ ./.

I/PPSS couldn't/MD* invite/VB Viola/NP to/IN our/PP$ house/NN ,/, for/CS Mother/NN snobbishly/RB refused/VBD to/TO receive/VB her/PPO ./.

Now/RB the/AT Czarship/NN had/HVD not/* affected/VBN my/PP$ own/JJ sense/NN of/IN social/JJ values/NNS ,/, but/CC Mother/NN had/HVD attained/VBN a/AT reflected/VBN glory/NN through/IN it/PPO ,/, which/WDT had/HVD opened/VBN the/AT doors/NNS of/IN Los/NP Angeles-Pasadena/NP Society/NN to/IN her/PPO ./.

There/RB ,/, Mother/NN was/BEDZ received/VBN by/IN the/AT scions/NNS of/IN aristocratic/JJ lines/NNS which/WDT are/BER dominated/VBN by/IN the/AT Budweisers/NPS (/( of/IN beer/NN derivation/NN )/) ,/, the/AT Chalmers/NPS (/( of/IN underwear/NN origin/NN )/) ,/, and/CC the/AT Heinzes/NPS (/( whose/WP$ forbears/NNS founded/VBD a/AT nationally/RB famous/JJ trade/NN in/IN pickles/NNS )/) ./.

I/PPSS hated/VBD being/BEG dragged/VBN into/IN the/AT salons/NNS of/IN these/DTS aristocrats/NNS ./.

But/CC Mother/NN insisted/VBD ,/, for/CS it/PPS is/BEZ seldom/RB indeed/QLP that/CS anyone/PN remotely/RB connected/VBN with/IN the/AT cinema/NN is/BEZ ever/RB received/VBN in/IN their/PP$ exclusive/JJ midsts/NNS ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PPS was/BEDZ not/* until/CS the/AT King/NN of/IN Spain/NP had/HVD visited/VBN at/IN Pickfair/NP that/CS Mary/NP and/CC Doug/NP were/BED beckoned/VBN to/TO cross/VB the/AT sacred/JJ barriers/NNS which/WDT separate/VB Los/NP Angeles/NP and/CC Pasadena/NP from/IN the/AT hoi-polloi/NNS ./.

Mother/NN even/RB went/VBD so/QL far/RB as/IN to/TO trump/VB up/RP for/IN me/PPO matrimonial/JJ opportunities/NNS with/IN Pasadena/NP debs/NNS who/WPS had/HVD been/BEN educated/VBN abroad/RB ,/, and/CC with/IN those/DTS of/IN the/AT more/QL lenient/JJ Los/NP Angeles/NP area/NN where/WRB a/AT debutante/NN was/BEDZ a/AT girl/NN who/WPS had/HVD been/BEN to/IN high/JJ school/NN ./.

But/CC at/IN long/JJ last/AP came/VBD a/AT time/NN when/WRB I/PPSS broke/VBD away/RB from/IN Mother/NN and/CC her/PP$ society/NN ``/`` chi-chi/NN ''/'' in/IN order/NN to/TO spend/VB a/AT cosy/JJ evening/NN with/IN Viola/NP and/CC her/PP$ chaperon/NN at/IN her/PP$ home/NR ./.

However/WRB ,/, such/ABL a/AT hotbed/NN of/IN gossip/NN had/HVD grown/VBN up/RP during/IN the/AT trial/NN ,/, that/CS every/AT precaution/NN had/HVD to/TO be/BE taken/VBN to/TO keep/VB my/PP$ visit/NN from/IN being/BEG whispered/VBN to/IN the/AT world/NN ,/, Society/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB ,/, alas/UH ,/, to/IN my/PP$ own/JJ mother/NN ./.

When/WRB I/PPSS arrived/VBD at/IN Viola's/NP$ I/PPSS was/BEDZ shown/VBN ,/, to/IN my/PP$ surprise/NN ,/, into/IN the/AT kitchen/NN ./.

Viola/NP greeted/VBD me/PPO ,/, in/IN checked/VBN apron/NN ,/, ladle/NN in/IN hand/NN ,/, and/CC explained/VBD it/PPS was/BEDZ the/AT cook's/NN$ night/NN out/RP and/CC that/CS she/PPS herself/PPL was/BEDZ preparing/VBG dinner/NN ./.

I/PPSS sat/VBD and/CC watched/VBD proceedings/NNS ./.

I/PPSS realized/VBD that/CS Hamlet/NP was/BEDZ faced/VBN with/IN an/AT entirely/QL different/JJ problem/NN ,/, but/CC his/PP$ agony/NN could/MD have/HV been/BEN no/AT greater/JJR ./.

The/AT most/AP that/DT was/BEDZ accomplished/VBN was/BEDZ adding/VBG Mrs./NP Beige's/NP$ tray/NN to/IN the/AT dish/NN pile/NN ,/, and/CC by/IN means/NNS of/IN repeated/VBN threats/NNS ,/, on/IN an/AT ascending/VBG scale/NN ,/, seeing/VBG that/CS the/AT girls/NNS dressed/VBD themselves/PPLS ,/, after/IN a/AT fashion/NN ./.

I/PPSS was/BEDZ saved/VBN from/IN making/VBG the/AT decision/NN as/CS the/AT phone/NN rang/VBD ,/, and/CC the/AT girls/NNS were/BED upon/IN me/PPO instantly/RB ./.

Here's/RB+BEZ a/AT household/NN hint/NN :/: if/CS you/PPSS can't/MD* find/VB your/PP$ children/NNS ,/, and/CC get/VB tired/VBN of/IN calling/VBG them/PPO ,/, pick/VB up/RP the/AT phone/NN ./.

No/AT matter/NN if/CS your/PP$ children/NNS are/BER at/IN the/AT movies/NNS ,/, in/IN school/NN ,/, visiting/VBG their/PP$ grandmother/NN ,/, or/CC on/IN a/AT field/NN trip/NN in/IN some/DTI distant/JJ city/NN ,/, they/PPSS will/MD be/BE upon/IN you/PPO magically/RB within/IN seconds/NNS after/CS you/PPSS pick/VB up/RP the/AT phone/NN ./.

Jennie/NP and/CC Miranda/NP twined/VBD themselves/PPLS around/IN me/PPO ,/, murmuring/VBG endearments/NNS ./.

Louise/NP climbed/VBD onto/IN a/AT stool/NN and/CC clutched/VBD the/AT hand/NN with/IN which/WDT I/PPSS was/BEDZ trying/VBG to/TO hold/VB the/AT phone/NN ,/, claiming/VBG my/PP$ immediate/JJ attention/NN on/IN grounds/NNS of/IN extreme/JJ emergency/NN ./.

Somehow/RB managing/VBG to/TO get/VB out/RP a/AT cool/JJ ,/, poised/VBN ,/, ``/`` Won't/MD* you/PPSS hold/VB on/RP a/AT second/NN ,/, please/UH ''/'' ,/, I/PPSS covered/VBD up/RP the/AT mouthpiece/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN more/AP warmth/NN and/CC less/AP poise/NN ,/, gave/VBD a/AT quick/JJ lecture/NN on/IN crime/NN and/CC punishment/NN ,/, mostly/RB the/AT latter/AP ,/, including/IN Devil's/NN$ Island/NN and/CC the/AT remoter/JJR reaches/NNS of/IN Siberia/NP ./.

I/PPSS promised/VBD to/TO illustrate/VB the/AT lecture/NN ,/, if/CS they/PPSS so/QL much/AP as/CS breathed/VBD till/CS after/CS the/AT call/NN was/BEDZ completed/VBN ./.

Speaking/VBG into/IN the/AT phone/NN again/RB and/CC recognizing/VBG the/AT caller/NN ,/, I/PPSS resumed/VBD my/PP$ everyday/JJ voice/NN ./.

Soon/RB we/PPSS were/BED deep/RB in/IN a/AT conversation/NN that/WPS was/BEDZ interrupted/VBN many/AP times/NNS by/IN little/AP things/NNS like/VB Jennie's/NP$ holding/NN her/PP$ breath/NN and/CC pretending/VBG to/TO black/VB out/RP ,/, Miranda's/NP$ dumping/NN the/AT contents/NNS of/IN the/AT sugar/NN bowl/NN on/IN the/AT table/NN ,/, and/CC various/JJ screeches/NNS ,/, thuds/NNS ,/, and/CC giggles/NNS ./.

Under/IN the/AT circumstances/NNS ,/, I/PPSS had/HVD difficulty/NN keeping/VBG up/RP with/IN the/AT conversation/NN on/IN the/AT phone/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB I/PPSS hung/VBD up/RP I/PPSS was/BEDZ reasonably/RB certain/JJ that/CS Francesca/NP had/HVD wanted/VBN to/TO remind/VB me/PPO of/IN our/PP$ town/NN meeting/NN the/AT next/AP evening/NN ,/, and/CC how/QL important/JJ it/PPS was/BEDZ that/CS Hank/NP and/CC I/PPSS be/BE there/RB ./.

It/PPS seemed/VBD that/CS I/PPSS would/MD be/BE the/AT gainer/NN if/CS I/PPSS accepted/VBD the/AT peace/NN and/CC quiet/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN carrying/VBG out/RP my/PP$ threats/NNS ./.

Their/PP$ two/CD boys/NNS were/BED ``/`` well/RB adjusted/VBN ''/'' and/CC ,/, like/CS their/PP$ parents/NNS ,/, always/RB did/DOD the/AT right/JJ thing/NN at/IN the/AT right/JJ time/NN and/CC damn/VB the/AT consequences/NNS ./.

Francesca/NP and/CC Herbert/NP considered/VBD themselves/PPLS violently/RB nonconformist/NN and/CC showed/VBD the/AT world/NN they/PPSS were/BED by/IN filling/VBG their/PP$ Colonial/JJ house/NN with/IN contemporary/JJ furniture/NN and/CC paintings/NNS and/CC other/AP art/NN objects/NNS (/( expensive/JJ ,/, but/CC not/* necessarily/RB valuable/JJ ,/, contemporary/JJ things/NNS )/) ./.

Fran/NP flaunted/VBD her/PP$ independence/NN by/IN rebelling/VBG against/IN the/AT Catatonia/NP uniform/NN of/IN Bermuda/NP shorts/NNS and/CC knee-length/JJ socks/NNS by/IN wearing/VBG Bermuda/NP shorts/NNS and/CC knee-length/JJ socks/NNS in/IN colors/NNS ;/. ;/.

No/AT one/PN could/MD dislike/VB them/PPO ,/, I/PPSS thought/VBD ./.

Sometimes/RB ,/, though/RB ,/, they/PPSS did/DOD not/* seem/VB quite/QL human/JJ ./.

Practically/RB the/AT only/AP enthusiasm/NN they/PPSS showed/VBD was/BEDZ when/WRB they/PPSS were/BED discussing/VBG ``/`` names/NNS ''/'' ;/. ;/.

Yes/RB ,/, Blanche/NP was/BEDZ very/QL ,/, very/QL sweet/JJ --/-- being/BEG in/IN her/PP$ company/NN was/BEDZ like/CS being/BEG drowned/VBN in/IN warm/JJ ,/, melted/VBN marshmallows/NNS ./.

Anyone/PN knows/VBZ how/WRB a/AT real/JJ ,/, red-blooded/JJ woman/NN would/MD react/VB to/IN such/ABL a/AT catastrophe/NN !/. !/.

Grazie/NP had/HVD a/AT small/JJ ,/, slick/JJ head/NN and/CC her/PP$ hair/NN and/CC skin/NN were/BED the/AT color/NN of/IN golden/JJ toast/NN ./.

She/PPS lived/VBD in/IN an/AT ultra-modern/JJ house/NN whose/WP$ decoration/NN ,/, appointments/NNS ,/, paint/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB pets/NNS were/BED chosen/VBN to/TO complement/VB her/PP$ coloring/NN ;/. ;/.

The/AT husbands/NNS of/IN these/DTS women/NNS and/CC others/NNS I/PPSS had/HVD met/VBN in/IN Catatonia/NP were/BED distinguished/VBN only/RB in/IN that/CS they/PPSS were/BED ,/, to/IN me/PPO at/IN least/AP ,/, indistinguishable/JJ ./.

They/PPSS were/BED ``/`` sincere/JJ ''/'' --/-- men/NNS of/IN the/AT too-hearty/JJ handclasp/NN and/CC the/AT urgent/JJ smile/NN ./.

These/DTS boys/NNS acknowledged/VBD an/AT introduction/NN to/IN anybody/PN by/IN gently/RB pressing/VBG one/CD of/IN his/PP$ hands/NNS in/IN both/ABX of/IN theirs/PP$$ ,/, while/CS they/PPSS gazed/VBD ,/, misty-eyed/JJ with/IN care/NN ,/, into/IN the/AT eyes/NNS of/IN the/AT person/NN they/PPSS were/BED meeting/VBG ./.

They/PPSS were/BED always/RB leaping/VBG to/TO light/VB cigarettes/NNS ,/, open/VB car/NN doors/NNS ,/, fill/VB plates/NNS or/CC glasses/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PPSS mistrusted/VBD the/AT whole/JJ lot/NN of/IN them/PPO to/IN the/AT same/AP degree/NN that/CS I/PPSS mistrusted/VBD bake/JJ shops/NNS that/WPS called/VBD themselves/PPLS ``/`` Sanitary/JJ Bake/JJ Shops/NNS ''/'' ./.

Becoming/VBG aware/JJ that/CS it/PPS was/BEDZ nearly/RB lunchtime/NN ,/, I/PPSS brought/VBD myself/PPL back/RB to/IN the/AT tasks/NNS at/IN hand/NN ./.

While/CS Mr./NP Blatz/NP was/BEDZ putting/VBG up/RP the/AT pegboards/NNS and/CC starting/VBG the/AT workbench/NN ,/, Mr./NP Crombie/NP told/VBD him/PPO of/IN this/DT idea/NN about/IN paneling/NN the/AT whole/JJ end/NN of/IN the/AT cellar/NN ./.

After/IN a/AT while/NN ,/, we/PPSS became/VBD aware/JJ that/CS the/AT money/NN was/BEDZ disappearing/VBG as/QL fast/JJ as/CS we/PPSS replenished/VBD it/PPO ./.
